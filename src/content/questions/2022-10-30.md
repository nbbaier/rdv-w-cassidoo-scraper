## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you print a balanced binary tree! This was tough, great job Jon, Amine, Max, Saad, Ten, and Stefan!

This week’s question:\
**Print the ASCII printable characters code page (0x20-0x7E), without any built-ins or functions that do it for you.**

Characters to be printed:

```
!"#$%&'()*+,-./
0123456789:;<=>?
@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_
\`abcdefghijklmno
pqrstuvwxyz{|}~
```
