## Interview question of the week

Last week, I asked you to tally the number of land masses in a matrix of 0s and 1s! Andrew Hall submitted his answer in Python! Nice work, Andrew!

This week's question:\
**Given an unsorted array arr and a number n, delete all numbers in arr that are greater than n.**
