## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you analyze baseball scores! Home run Gavin, Ender, György, Juliano, Rafael, Paul, Ten, Taylor, David, Elke, and Stephen!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that determines if a number is abundant, deficient, perfect, or amicable.** (Thanks Raymond for this one!)

Examples:

```
whatKindOfNumber(6)
> 'perfect'

whatKindOfNumber(12)
> 'abundant'

whatKindOfNumber(4)
> 'deficient'
```
