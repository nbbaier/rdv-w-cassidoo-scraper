## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you draw a Pride flag! I loved seeing the creativity of everyone's responses in so many different languages. Amazing work Ritik, Sreetam, Jai, Ricardo, Maxime, Rahmat, Jesper, Dani, David, Augustin, Jay, Rafael, Claude, Zoe, Ten, Aodhan, Ben, Leyan, Weilbyte, and Vanessa!

This week's question:\
**Imagine your users are all typing *slightly* incorrectly, in that they shifted their hands one key to the right. Write a function that translates what they mean to say.**

Example:

```
$ translateShift(';p; epe')
"lol wow"

$ translateShift('vtsmnrttu')
"cranberry"
```
