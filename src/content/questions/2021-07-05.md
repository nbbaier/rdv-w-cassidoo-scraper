 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Imagine your users are all typing *slightly* incorrectly, in that they shifted their hands one key to the right. Write a function that translates what they mean to say.**

Example:

```
$ translateShift(';p; epe')
"lol wow"

$ translateShift('vtsmnrttu')
"cranberry"
```
