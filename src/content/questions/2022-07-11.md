 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given a linked list, such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list, or null, make a *deep* copy of the list and return the `head` node of the new copy.** If you need to look up details about a deep copy, check here and here!

Node definition:

```
class Node {
    int val;
    Node next;
    Node random;

    public Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
        this.random = null;
    }
}
```
