## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you look at visible buildings in a line! I loved seeing so many good answers! Great work Andreas, David, Ender, Mac, Muhammad, Miguel, Ashish, Kyle, Neil, Arban, David, Mudi, Danny, Jess, Sean, Ricardo, Amine, Jess, Sean, Ricardo, Amine, Prashant, Ten, Kriszti, and Daniel!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of integers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that determines the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock once.** If no profit can be made, return 0.

Example:

```
> maxTheStock([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])
> 5 // (buy at 1, sell at 6)

> maxTheStock([7, 6, 4, 3, 1])
> 0 // (no profit possible)
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on Bluesky, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Mastodon)
