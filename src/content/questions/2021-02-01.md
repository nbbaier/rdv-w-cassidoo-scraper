## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you rotate an n x n array 90 degrees. You know, theoretically y'all who did this could turn your algorithms into a little Tetris game... tempting, huh? Anyway, awesome work Dhanush, Vishwa, Leyan, Luciano, Ale, Gustavo, Leslie, Elliot, Timotius, Taylor, Jonathan, Pozorvlak, Alberto, Kyle, Rafael, Jose, Ivana, Griffin, Ten, and Carlos!

This week's question:\
**You are given a snapshot of a queue of stocks that have changing prices coming in from a stream. Remove the outdated stocks from the queue.**

Example:

```
$ snapshot = [
  { sym: 'GME', cost: 280 },
  { sym: 'PYPL', cost: 234 },
  { sym: 'AMZN', cost: 3206 },
  { sym: 'AMZN', cost: 3213 },
  { sym: 'GME', cost: 325 }
]
$ stockQueue(snapshot)
$ [{ sym: 'PYPL', cost: 234 },
   { sym: 'AMZN', cost: 3213 },
   { sym: 'GME', cost: 325 }]
```
