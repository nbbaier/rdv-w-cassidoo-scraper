## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you count array rotations. Great work Ten, Altamish, Kyle, José, Austin, Neil, Saad, Tawseef, Muhammad, Anirban, Evan, and David!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of integers, return the majority element.** If there is no majority element, return if the array is majority even or odd numbers, and if there is none, say so.

Example:

```
> majority([3,1,4,1])
> "1"

> majority([33,44,55,66,77])
> "Majority odds"

> majority([1,2,3,4])
> "No majority"
```
