## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return the largest number from two integer arrays! There was actually a typo in the example, thanks all y’all who found it. I fixed it in the archive for those checking it out later! Awesome work Ashleigh, Jesse, Lucie, Timar, Leslie, Robin, Elliot, Dimitris, Sam, Giuseppe, Tobias, Tom, David, Leyan, Dhanush, Sridhar, Kartik, Aditya, Caroline, Amy, Michael, Damien, Manoj, Vanessa, ValeYellow46, Kyle, Maximiliano, Becker, Steve, Mark, Chris, Daniel, Jonathan, Ivana, Paul, Jay, Yosef, Karey, Shreya, Luciano, Max, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string, return true if the string represents a valid number.** A valid number can include integers, a `.`, `-`, or `+`.

Examples of valid numbers: “7”, “0011”, “+3.14”, “4.”, “-.9”, “-123.456”, “-0.1”

Examples of invalid numbers: “abc”, “1a”, “e8”, “–6”, “-+3”, “95x54e53.”
