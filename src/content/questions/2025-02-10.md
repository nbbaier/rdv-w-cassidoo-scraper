## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you evaluate postfix expressions! I love questions like these ones, and y'all had some good answers. Awesome work Taylor, Muhammad, Mudasir, Rekha, Amine, Peter, Sreetam, Ashish, Stephen, Vanessa, Nic, Ricardo, Ten, Robert, Winnie, Tim, and Neha!

This week's question:\
**Given the current system of NFL uniform numbers, a given player's position, and an array of existing numbers on the team, write a function that returns a list of numbers that the given player can choose from for their uniform.**

Example:

```
> availableNumbers("QB", [1, 2, 3, 10, 19])
> [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on Bluesky, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Mastodon)
