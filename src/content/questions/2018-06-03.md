 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a function that returns the sum of 1\*1! + 2\*2! +... + n\*n! given n. Here's my solution to the problem!

function factSum(n) {\
return \_factorialize(n+1) - 1;\
}\
// My helper function that returns a factorial:\
function \_factorialize(num) {\
if (num < 0) return -1;\
else if (num === 0) return 1;\
else {\
return (num \* \_factorialize(num - 1));\
}\
}

This week's question:\
**Given a queue, write a recursive function to reverse it.**

## Joke

My husband gives me alphabet soup all the time, claiming I love it, but I don't. He's just putting words in my mouth!
