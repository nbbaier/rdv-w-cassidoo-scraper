## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find distinct combinations of integers! Great job Ten, Jesper, Deepak, William, Wannes, Tobias, Les, Ben, Griffin, and Rafael!

This week’s question:\
**An “odious number” is a non-negative number that has an odd number of 1s in its binary expansion. Write a function that returns true if a given number is odious.**

Example:

```
$ isOdious(14)
$ true

$ isOdious(5)
$ false
```
