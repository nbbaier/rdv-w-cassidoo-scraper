## Interview question of the week

This past week, I had you do some math by finding trailing zeros in a base 16 factorial. We got some great answers from Kyle, Dimitris (who did it twice!!), Ethan, Mike, and  Stuart!

This week's question:\
**Find and return the maximum depth of parenthesis given a string. If the parenthesis are unbalanced, return -1.**

Example:\
parenDepth("( a((b)) ((c)d) )")\
\> 3\
parenDepth("b) (c) ()")\
\> -1\
parenDepth("who am I and where do I belong")\
\> 0
