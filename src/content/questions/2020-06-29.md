## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find a list of medians of subarrays in an array. It was a toughie, great work Gabor, Louis, Kamal, Dani, Jasper, Roman, Matt, Jaime, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given string S, print the longest subsequence from S that contains alternating vowels and consonants.** If multiple such subsequences exist having the same length, print the subsequence with the maximum sum of ASCII values of its characters.

Example:

```
$ alternateChars('ababab')
$ 'ababab'
$ alternateChars('cassidyisanerd')
$ 'casiyisaner'
```
