## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you determine the rows people would take up in a theater. This one snuck up on you! A few folks said it was really fun to solve and I'm glad. Great job Nathael, Andy, Amine, Muhammad, Ricardo, Tawseef, Ten, Kyle, Sujeet, Kriszti, Jeremias, and David!

This week's question:

**You are given an integer `n` representing the total points a team wants to score in an American football game. You need to determine the number of unique ways the team can achieve exactly `n` points using any combination of touchdowns (6 points), field goals (3 points), or safeties (2 points).**

Example:

```
> waysToScore(5)
> 1

> waysToScore(12)
> 6

> waysToScore(6)
> 3
```
