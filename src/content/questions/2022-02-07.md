 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question is brought to you by Elementary!\
**Implement a word search. Given a 2D array of letters and a word to find, return the 2D array with the found word’s letters replaced with an asterisk (`*`).** If you can’t find a word, just return the 2D array or “not found”.

Example:

```
let grid = [['a','a','q','t'],
            ['x','c','w','e'],
            ['r','l','e','p']]

$ findWord(grid, 'ace')
$ [['*','a','q','t'],
   ['x','*','w','e'],
   ['r','l','*','p']]
```

If you’ve ever wanted to explore audio software, but felt it was a little too complicated, this blurb is for you. Elementary is a functional, declarative framework for writing audio software in JavaScript that feels a lot like React. Develop in your browser, ship as an audio plugin for a DAW (like Ableton Live) and more.
