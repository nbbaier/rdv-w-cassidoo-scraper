## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return pairs of odd numbers. Y'all did great Andy, Martin, Lars, David, Winnie, Miguel, Ten, Yacine, Neha, Muhammad, Elke, Tarang, Jeremias, Kracekumar, and Will!

This week's question:\
**Turn an array of integers into a nested array.** You can think of this as the opposite of flattening an array!

Examples:

```
nestArray([1, 2, 3, 4])
> [1, [2, [3, [4]]]]

nestArray([1])
> [1]
```
