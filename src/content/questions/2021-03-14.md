## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find out if a tic-tac-toe game was valid! This was a good test of if you want to choose recursion or a loop, we had a good mix of both! Great work Leyan, Charles, Dimitris, Elliot, Aditya, Taylor, Luciano, Leslie, Michael, Steve, Max, Surbhi, Mark, David, Ivana, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given a rowIndex, return an array of the values in that row of Pascal’s Triangle.**

Example:

```
$ pascals(0)
$ [1]
$ pascals(3)
$ [1,3,3,1]
```
