## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement a Minesweeper grid! Awesome work Gabor, Michael, Alex, Nathan, Mark, Ten, Andrew, Tobias, Craig, Leyan, Jesper, Michael, Les, Andy, David, and Oana!

This week's question:\
**Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.**

Example:

```
$ pSubstring('babad')
$ 'bab' // or 'aba'
```
