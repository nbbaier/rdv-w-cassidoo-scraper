## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you assess a reversed perfect square! Good job Mica, Miguel, Jonnie, Clifford, Saad, Muhammad, Dale, Laurynas, Umar, Ollie, Andrew, Connor, Leo, Gerardo, Sreetam, Ángel, Mazen, Jakob, Ten, Craig, Manuel, Rob, and Austin!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of strings and a max width, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully justified.** You can choose how you want to wrap a word.

Example:

```
> justifyText(["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], 16)
> [
    "This    is    an",
    "example  of text",
    "justification.  "
  ]
```
