## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find a subarray with the largest sum in an array. I loved seeing all the unique responses to this one! Awesome job Andrew, Dan, Binh, Dani, Abdulrahman, Kamil, Kev, Rob, Seth, Will, Claude, Amine, Conor, Liam, Mark, Samuel, Leyan, Steven, Rafael, Giancarlo, Brad, Joseph, Nischal, Tyson, Giovanni, Gülşah, Ten, Les, and Augustin!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of intervals, merge the overlapping intervals, and return an array of the resulting intervals.**

Example:

```
$ mergeIntervals([[1,4],[2,6],[8,10],[15,20]])
$ [[1,6],[8,10],[15,20]]

$ mergeIntervals([[1,2],[2,7]])
$ [[1,7]]
```
