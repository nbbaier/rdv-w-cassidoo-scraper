 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given a grid size, and a set of mines (in pairs of rows and columns), generate the Minesweeper grid for that set of mines.** You can use asterisks for mines, and an x for 0!

Example:

```
let gridSize = 5
let mines = [[1, 3], [3, 5], [2, 4]]

$ generateMinesweeper(gridSize, mines)

xxxxx
11xxx
*21xx
2*21x
12*1x
```
