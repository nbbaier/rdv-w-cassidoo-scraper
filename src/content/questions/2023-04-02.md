## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you roll some dice based on dice notation! There were some fun responses to this one! Great job Greg, Zoé, Robin, Miguel, Chase, Saad, Austin, Ciprian, Alvin, Dan, Christian, Chris, Daniel, Danny, Ángel, Muhammad, and Holger!

This week's question (kind of a funky one for a fun day):\
**Write a program that prints the amount of characters its source has in English words.** So a program that is 44 characters long would output "forty four" and a program that is 108 characters long would output "one hundred eight".
