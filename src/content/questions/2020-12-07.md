## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to a target value. Great work Laura, Elliot, Jayphen, Mike, Jonathan, Ephraim, Adam, Rafael, Romain, Leyan, Lakshay, Chera, Sreetam, Prakash, voknelis, Aldrin, Ivana, Roupen, Remo, William, Chera, Kikwei, Jesús, Atharva, Rizwan, John, Ilya, Roman, Mickael, Vishwa, Namrata, Pozorvlak, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given two non-negative integers n1 and n2 represented as strings, return the product of n1 and n2, also represented as a string.** Neither input will start with 0, and don't just convert it to an integer and do the math that way.

Examples:

```
$ stringMultiply("123", "456")
$ "56088"
```
