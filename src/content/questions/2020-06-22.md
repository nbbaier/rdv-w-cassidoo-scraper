 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given an unsorted array arr of integers and an index n, return a list of medians of the subarrays in arr (where the first subarray is from index 0 to index 1, the next from 0 to index 2… index 0 to index n).** Try to do it in better than O(n^2) time!

Example:

```
$ findMedians([2, 1, 3, 10, 5], 3)
$ [2, 1.5, 2]
```
