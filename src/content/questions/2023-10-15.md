## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you convert a number in English words to an integer. This was hard!! Amazing job Usman, Tawseef, Akhilarka, Ten, Karthick, and Robin!

This week's question:\
**Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.** Two strings are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one mapping possible for every character of the first string to every character of the second string.

Example:

```
> isIsomorphic('abb', 'cdd')
> true // 'a' maps to 'c' and 'b' maps to 'd'

> isIsomorphic('cassidy', '1234567')
> false // 's' cannot have a mapping to both '3' and '4'

> isIsomorphic('cass', '1233')
> true
```
