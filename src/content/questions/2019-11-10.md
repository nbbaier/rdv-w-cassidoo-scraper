 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week was a puzzler! I had you get the maximum path sum of a binary tree. Well done  Alex, Dan, Sophie, John, Hollywoo, Matthew, Stuart, Andrew, and  Nick!

This week's question:\
**Write a program that implements logic gates AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.**

Examples:\
\> logicGate('AND', 1, 1)\
\> 1\
\> logicGate('NOT', 1)\
\> 0\
\> logicGate('NAND', 1, 0)\
\> 1\
\> logicGate('NOR', 0, 0)\
\> 1
