 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given an array of increasing integers, find the length of the longest fibonacci-like subsequence of the array. If one does not exist, return 0.** A sequence is "fibonacci-like" if X\_i + X\_{i+1} = X\_{i+2}.

Example:

```
$ fibonacciLike([1,3,7,11,12,14,18])
$ 3 // these sequences: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18]
```
