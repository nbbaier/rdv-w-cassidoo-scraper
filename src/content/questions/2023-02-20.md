## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you print the numbers 1-100 without using the digits from 1-9 in your code. There were some *really* amusing and clever solutions! Extra credit goes to those who didn’t use 0, either! Awesome job Tamás, Sage, Augustin, Invader Zim, Robin, Fernando, Andy, Scott, Alfonso, Baudelaire, Miguel, Dan, Josh, Sigmund, Ten, Saad, y0landi, Will, Jesper, Andrew, Derfi, Nate, 413, Vyaas, Danny, Nick, Jack, Mike, Leyan, Les, Ruben, Elizabeth, Ángel, Joseph, Dan, Hristiyan, Don, Chapter, Carine, Sylvain, Churchill, Max, Kyle, Sreetam, Remo, Alberto, Chris, Rick, Johannes, and Paweł!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string of parenthesis, return the number of parenthesis you need to add to the string in order for it to be balanced.**

Examples:

```
> numBalanced(\`()\`)
> 0

> numBalanced(\`(()\`)
> 1

> numBalanced(\`))()))))()\`)
> 6

> numBalanced(\`)))))\`)
> 5
```
