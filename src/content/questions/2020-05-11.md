## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you check which words can be written on a single row on the keyboard. Amazing work Kyle, Sam, JD, Ten, Jake, Jasper, Chris, Mikey, Daniel, Sameer, Kori, Seth, Arkady, Evan, Linda, Qais, Sean, Stuart, Collin, Artem, and Felabon!

This week’s question:\
**Given two numbers X and Y, write a function to check that X and Y are in golden ratio.**

Two numbers are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities. Check out the formula here.
