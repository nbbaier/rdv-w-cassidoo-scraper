 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last time, I had you return a pair whose product is closest to a number, given an array and said number. Thomas Vaeth did a great job with his solution!

I'm excited about this week's question, it's funky (and one that someone was given recently *in real life*):\
**Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.**

Example:\
waterTrap(\[2,0,2])\
\> 2\
Structure is like this:

```
| |
|_|
```

waterTrap({3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4})\
\>10\
Structure is like this:

```
|
|    |
|  | |
|__|_|
```

(We can trap 6 units of water between 3 and 2, 1 unit on top of bar 2, and 3 units between 2\
and 4)
