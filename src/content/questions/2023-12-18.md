## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return the majority element in an array. Awesome work Neil, Miguel, Altamish, Muhammad, Saad, Josh, Jacob, Austin, Ten, Maciej, and Matteo!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that determines if an array of numbers is a bitonic sequence.** A bitonic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the numbers are in increasing order, and after a certain point, they start decreasing. Extra credit: print the peak number in the sequence!

Example:

```
> isBitonic([1,2,3,2])
> true // extra credit: 3

> isBitonic([1,2,3])
> false

> isBitonic([3,4,5,5,5,2,1])
> true // extra credit: 5
```
