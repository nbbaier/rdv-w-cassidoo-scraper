## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you check if two numbers are in golden ratio with each other. Great job Andrii, Sameer, Matt, Ten, Jasper, Dominik, Will, Jesse, Dan, Alex, Dimitris, Kyle, and Linda!

This week's question:\
**Design a simplified version of Twitter, where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow others, and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the user's news feed.**

Some useful functions to include would be `getNewsFeed(userid)`, `postTweet(userid, tweet)`, `follow(follower, followee)`, and `unfollow(follower, followee)`.
