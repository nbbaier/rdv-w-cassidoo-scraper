## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you compress an array of characters! Good work Kracekumar, Kyle, Neha, Miguel, Ross, Austin, Andrew, Ashuzon, Roodz, David, Muhammad, Ten, Jeremias, and Danny!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the longest string that is a prefix of at least two strings in the list.**

Examples:

```
longestCommonPrefix(["flower","flow","flight"])
"flow"

longestCommonPrefix(["dog","racecar","car"])
""

longestCommonPrefix(["interstellar","internet","interval"])
"inter"
```
