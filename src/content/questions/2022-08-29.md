 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question is brought to you by Applitools!\
**Write a set of tests for a function that adds numbers from many invocations, until it sees an empty invocation.** Consider edge cases, side effects, incorrect usage of the function, and expected values!

Function to test:

```
function addg(a) {
    if (a === undefined) return a;
    return function g(b) {
        if (b !== undefined) {
            return addg(a+b);
        }
        return a;
    };
}

// Example usage:
/*
  addg()           // undefined
  addg(2)()        // 2
  addg(2)(7)()     // 9
  addg(3)(4)(0)()  // 7
*/
```

There's a lot of buzz around Playwright and Cypress, but which is better? Andy Knight and Filip Hric are jumping back into the ring for another round of Cypress vs Playwright: Let the Code Speak. They'll dive deeper to show how these tools perform in real life, and Beth Marshall will be there to ensure a fair fight. Don’t miss it.
