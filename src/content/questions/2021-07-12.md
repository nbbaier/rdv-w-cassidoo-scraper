## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you translate a string based on someone moving their hands over a set of keys! Lots of interesting solutions this week, great work Leyan, Rahmat, Ricardo, Clov, Maxime, David, Claude, Vivek, Craig, Jesper, Levi, Craig, Carlos, Les, Andrew, Ivana, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given an IPv4 address and a netmask in CIDR notation, return a boolean specifying whether the IP address is inside the given range.**

Example:

```
$ inRange("192.168.4.27", "192.168.0.0/16")
$ true

$ inRange("192.168.4.27", "192.168.1.0/24")
$ false
```

This week’s question is brought to you by Fauna, the modern Data API with native GraphQL support!
