## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the number of items in a closed compartment. Awesome job Gabor, Thillai, Leyan, Ten, Rafael, Adam, Joel, Giancarlo, Will, Dan, Andrew, Gülşah, Les, Don, Claude, Jonathan, and Ivana!

This week's question is brought to you by Stytch!\
**Given two strings n and m, return true if they are equal when both are entered into text editors. But: a `#` means a backspace character (deleting backwards), and a `%` means a delete character (deleting forwards).**

Example:

```
> equalWithDeletions("a##x", "#a#x")
> true      // both strings become "x"

> equalWithDeletions("fi##f%%%th %%year #time###", "fifth year time")
> false     // the first string becomes "fart"
```
