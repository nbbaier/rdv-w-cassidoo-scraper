## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you get a row from Pascal’s Triangle! Tons of cool approaches to this one, nice work Leslie, Jonathan, Taylor, David, Luciano, Dhanush, Patrick, Sreetam, Aditya, Sam, Leyan, Jay, Noj, Gerhard, Rubén, Jihchi, Steve, Max, Ten, Carlo, and Elliot!

This week’s question:\
**You’re given two integer arrays (`n` and `m`), and an integer `k`. Using the digits from `n` and `m`, return the largest number you can of length `k`.**

Example:

```
n = [3,4,6,5]
m = [9,0,2,5,8,3]
k = 5
$ maxNum(n, m, k)
$ 98655
```

Note: The original message here had a typo where the answer said `98653`!
