 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**You’re given two integer arrays (`n` and `m`), and an integer `k`. Using the digits from `n` and `m`, return the largest number you can of length `k`.**

Example:

```
n = [3,4,6,5]
m = [9,0,2,5,8,3]
k = 5
$ maxNum(n, m, k)
$ 98655
```

Note: The original message here had a typo where the answer said `98653`!
