## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find a minimum value in a pivoted array. Y’all did great on this one! Awesome job Gabor, Wade, Mike, Anthony, Sam, Sophie, Lakshay, 40arc, Ali, Jagadish, Ten, Meagan, Kevin, Christopher, Pozorvlak, Gul, Namrata, Rafael, Arvin, Rizwan, Jeff, Tim, Leslie, and William!

This week’s question:\
**Given a basic Lisp-like string expression, parse it (where the available functions are add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and they all take in 2 values).**

Examples:

```
$ babyLisp('(add 1 2)')
$ 3

$ babyLisp('(multiply 4 (add 2 3))')
$ 20
```
