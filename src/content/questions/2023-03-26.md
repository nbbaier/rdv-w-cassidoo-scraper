## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you convert between color formats! This involved some funky math, and y'all did awesome work, particularly Fraol, Saad, Ten, Danny, Ángel, Christian, and Will!

This week's question (thanks Gabor!):\
**Given a string in dice notation, return a random integer you can get by rolling those dice.**

Example:

```
> rollDice('4d4') // Four 4-sided dice
> 13

> rollDice('3d20') // Three 20-sided dice
> 28

> rollDice('1d8+2d10') // One 8-sided dice, and two 10-sided dice
> 21
```
