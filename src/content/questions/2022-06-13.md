## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out coin combinations. There's some really cool answers this week (including FORTRAN??), awesome work Will, Ten, Leyan, Zoe, Ramon, Mo, Amine, Dan, Giovanni, Hristiyan, Ezell, Nicole, Kelvin, Divyansh, and Shriyash!

This week's question:\
**Create a loooong teeeext generator that takes in a string and an integer `n`, and multiplies the vowels in the string by `n`.**

Example:

```
$ longText('hello world', 3)
$ 'heeellooo wooorld'

$ longText('lol', 10)
$ 'looooooooool'
```
