## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you remove a folder from a list in a filesystem. This was a little tricky, nice work Sarah, Vanessa, Dhanush, Achraf, Mike, Adam, Ephraim, Ten, Vishwa, David, Paul, Leyan, Andrew, Ilya, Enri, William, Ivana, and Clov!

This week's question:\
**You are building stories into an app. Your inputs are an object with the structure { username, postedAt }, and a date in the future. Each story lives for 24 hours. Write a function that outputs the stories that are visible for the inputted time.**
