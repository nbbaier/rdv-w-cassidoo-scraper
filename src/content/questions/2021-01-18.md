 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Design a hashmap without using any built-in libraries.** You should include the following functions:

* put(key, value): Insert a (key, value) pair into the hashmap. If the value already exists, update the value.
* get(key): Returns the value to which key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains nothing for key.
* remove(key): Remove the mapping for the value in key if it exists.
