## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement a circular linked list! In case you need some direction with that, here's a great guide on the subject.

This week's question:\
**Given a string of characters with a bunch of opening and closing parenthesis, remove the excess parenthesis.**

Example:\
balance('4-3)+5+)6+(5+9)\*(8)+9(')\
\> 4-3+5+6+(5+9)\*(8)+9
