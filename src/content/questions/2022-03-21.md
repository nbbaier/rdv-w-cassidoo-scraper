## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you rotate Tetris blocks! This is a difficult one, great job Ten, Dan, Jonathan, and Rafael!

This week's question:\
**Given a list of times in a 24-hour period, return the smallest interval between two times in the list.** Hint: you can do this in O(n) time! Assume the list is unsorted.

Example:

```
$ smallestTimeInterval(['01:00', '08:15', '11:30', '13:45', '14:10', '20:05'])
$ '25 minutes'
```
