## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write the psuedocode for an algorithm that determines if one of the numbers is present for more than half the list.

I ended up writing code for it because I kept questioning myself. Classic.

```
function majority(arr) {
var candidate = 0, // doesn't matter what this is initialized to
  count = 0,
  ret = 'none',
  arrSize = arr.length / 2;
```
