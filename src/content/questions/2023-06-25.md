## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you calculate the depth of JSON data! Amazing work Rob, Clifford, Jonnie, Leyan, Lenz, Sreetam, Amine, Vishwa, Craig, Ángel, Ten, and Manuel!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes an array of consecutive, increasing letters as input, and returns any missing letters in the array between the first and last letter.**

Example:

```
> missingLetters(['a','b','c','d','f'])
> ['e']

> missingLetters(['a','b','c','d','e','h','i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p','q','r','s','t','u','w','x','y','z'])
> ['f','g','v']
```
