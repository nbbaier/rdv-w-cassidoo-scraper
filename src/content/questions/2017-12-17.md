## Interview question of the week

Last time, I had you sort a stack of integers from least to greatest using another stack.\
Here's a solution to the problem:

```
public static Stack<Integer> sortstack(Stack<Integer> input) {
  Stack<Integer> tmpStack = new Stack<Integer>();
  while(!input.isEmpty()) {
    int tmp = input.pop();
    while(!tmpStack.isEmpty() && tmpStack.peek() > tmp) {
      input.push(tmpStack.pop());
    }
    tmpStack.push(tmp);
  }
  return tmpStack;
}
```

Here's this week's question!\
Write a function that prints a Christmas (or just pine) tree with N rows.

Example:

```
> printTree(3)
​  *
