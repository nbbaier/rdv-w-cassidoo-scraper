## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you segment words based on a dictionary! It was a funky one and y'all did great! Awesome job Muhammad, Ben, Pozorvlak, Sean, Philip John, Mazen, Ricardo, Mikayla, Amine, Vincent, Gu, John, and Ten!

This week's question:

**Write a function that converts between metric and imperial units.** Break up the units into millimeters, centimeters, and meters for metric, and into inches and feet for imperial, up to 2 decimal places.

Example:

```
> convertUnits(7, "ft")
> "2m 13cm 3.6mm"

> convertUnits(44, "cm")
> "1ft 5.32in"
```
