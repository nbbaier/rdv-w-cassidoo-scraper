## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you print arrows in different directions. So many loops, so little time! Awesome job Gu, Ryan, Amine, John, Ten, Altamish, Kyle, Ricardo, Mazen, Tom, and Omri!

This week's question:\
**Imagine the users on your app are all typing *slightly* incorrectly, in that they shifted their hands one key to the right. Write a function that translates what they mean to say.** The examples below assume an ANSI keyboard layout, you can choose how you want to do that!

Example:

```
> translateRightShift(';p; epeor')
"lol wowie"

> translateRightShift('ejp s, o')
"who am i"
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on LinkedIn, Twitter, Mastodon, or Bluesky)
