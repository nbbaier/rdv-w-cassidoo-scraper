## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you split up a string into specified widths! Good job Ten, Paul, Ross, Micah, David, Toni, Jeremias, Dave, Amine, George, and Kaartic!

This week's question:\
**Given a field represented as an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 means that position needs protection, you can place a scarecrow at any index, and each scarecrow protects up to `k`  consecutive positions centered around itself (for example, for  `k = 3`, a scarecrow at  `i`  protects  `i-1`, `i`, and  `i+1`). Return the minimum set of indices where scarecrows should be placed so that all the positions with 1 are protected.** You can assume `k` is an odd number (or make up what happens if it's even).

Examples:

```
let field = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1];
let k = 3;

placeScarecrows(field, k);
> [1, 4, 6]

placeScarecrows([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], k)
> [1, 4]

placeScarecrows([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 1)
> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
