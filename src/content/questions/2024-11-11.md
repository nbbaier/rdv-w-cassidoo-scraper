## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you group anagrams! This one was really fun. Awesome work Alisa, Andreas, Muhammad, Yacine, Ten, Leyan, Mac, Yacine, Anton, Kyle, Miguel, Andrew, Ashish, Alison, Jeremias, Ricardo, Charles, Amine, Chase, John, and Jess!

This week's question:\
**Given a list of integers representing the heights of buildings, return the maximum number of buildings that can be seen when looking from the left. A building can see another building if it is taller than all the buildings to its left.** The height of the tallest building is included in the count.

Examples:

```
seeBuildingsLeft([1,2,3,4,5])
5

seeBuildingsLeft([5,4,3,2,1])
1

seeBuildingsLeft([3,7,8,3,6,1])
3
```
