## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a laundry generator function. Squeaky clean good job Paul, Ten, Ender, Ida, Collin, Miguel, Elke, Jonathan, Kriszti, Dani, Vasanth, Andrew, Pedro, Victor, Christian, Stephen, Laasya, Amine, and Jeremias!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of order objects for a restaurant, each with a table number and a list of ordered items, write a function that returns an object mapping each table number to a summary of how many times each item was ordered at that table.** Extra credit: Could you go so far as to make this a restaurant management game?

Example:

```
const orders = [
  { table: 1, items: ["burger", "fries"] },
  { table: 2, items: ["burger", "burger", "fries"] },
  { table: 1, items: ["salad"] },
  { table: 2, items: ["fries"] }
];

> orderSummary(orders)
{
  1: { burger: 1, fries: 1, salad: 1 },
  2: { burger: 2, fries: 2 }
}
// or, string output format:
"Table 1 ordered 1 burger, 1 fries, and 1 salad. Table 2 ordered 2 burgers and 2 fries."
```
