## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a multiply function in JavaScript which will produce the following outputs when invoked:\
console.log(mul(2)(3)(4)); // output: 24\
console.log(mul(4)(3)(4)); // output: 48

Here's my solution:

```
function mul(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return function(c) {
      return a*b*c;
    }
  };
}
```

Here's a similar question for you this week:

**Write a function addg that adds from many invocations until it sees an empty invocation.**

```
addg()  // undefined
  addg(2)()  // 2
  addg(2)(7)()  // 9
  addg(3)(4)(0)()  // 7
  addg(1)(2)(4)(8)()  // 15
```
