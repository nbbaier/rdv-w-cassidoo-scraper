## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you maximize your profit in the stock market! To the moooooon Ender, Marco, David, Muhammad, Sophie, Ross, Kyle, Austin, Ian, Ten, Ross, Kyle, Austin, Ian, John, Amine, Kriszti, Chase, Ricardo, Alison, and Murtala!

This week's question:

**You're organizing a family meal. Given a list of dishes and their respective preparation times, return the minimum number of hours required to prepare all dishes if you can cook up to two dishes simultaneously.** If a dish takes longer than the remaining time of the current hour, it will be moved to the next hour.

Examples:

```
// Using number of minutes for prep time

mealPrep([120])
2 // one single long dish

mealPrep([30, 30, 30, 20])
1 // multiple shorter dishes

mealPrep([30, 25, 45, 30, 60, 15])
3 // many dishes with varying times
```
