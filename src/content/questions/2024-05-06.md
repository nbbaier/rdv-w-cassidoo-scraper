## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you build a keyboard for users who typed slightly wrong. Awesome work Louis, Altamish, Ten, Maciej, Ashish, Ryan, Omri, Mazen, Kyle, Tawseef, John, and Sam!

This week's question:\
**Write a "word wrapping" function that takes in a string and the maximum width of a line of text, and return the text "wrapped" to that line length.** Include dashes for broken words (which is included in the length of that line), and don't let a line start with a non-alphanumeric character.

Example:

```
let string = "Hello, world! I am hungry."
let length = 10

> wrap(string, length)
\`Hello, wo-
 rld! I am
 hungry.\`
```
