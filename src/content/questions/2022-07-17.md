 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given a string that has a valid email address, write a function to hide the first part of the email (before the `@` sign), minus the first and last character.** For extra credit, add a flag to hide the second part after the `@` sign to your function excluding the first character and the domain extension.

Examples:

```
> hideEmail('example@example.com')
> 'e*****e@example.com'

> hideEmail('example+test@example.co.uk', hideFull)
> 'e**********t@e******.co.uk'
```
