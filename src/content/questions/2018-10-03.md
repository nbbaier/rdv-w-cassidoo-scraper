## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement a power function! Daniel sent this one in in C#:

static double Pow(double b, double exp)\
{\
if (exp == 0) return 1;\
else if (exp > 0) return b \* Pow(b, exp - 1);\
else return 1 / Pow(b, -exp);\
}

This week's question:\
**In a linked list, if the next() pointer of the last node points to the head node, it becomes circular linked list. Implement a circular linked list!**
