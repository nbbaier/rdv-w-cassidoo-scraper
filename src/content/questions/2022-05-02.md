## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you merge intervals together. This was a sneakily tricky one! Great job Will, Andrew, Jonathan, Leyan, Les, Rafael, Tyson, Dan, Divyansh, Gülşah, Amine, Thierry, Don, Steven, Claude, Ten, Conor, and Giancarlo!

This week's question:\
**Implement a simple version of autocomplete, where given an input string `s` and a dictionary of words `dict`, return the word(s) in `dict` that partially match `s` (or an empty string if nothing matches).**

Example:

```
let dict = ['apple', 'banana', 'cranberry', 'strawberry']

$ simpleAutocomplete('app')
$ ['apple']

$ simpleAutocomplete('berry')
$ ['cranberry', 'strawberry']

$ simpleAutocomplete('fart')
$ []
```
