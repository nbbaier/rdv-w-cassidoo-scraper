## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement remote control directions. Awesome job Will, Leyan, Les, Dani, Rodolphe, Rafael, Will, Babajide, Ten, Danny, Dan, Jonathan, and Matt!

This week’s question:\
**Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the sub-sequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.**

Example:

```
$ longestSubSeq([1, 9, 87, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2, 45])
$ 4 // 1, 3, 4, 2

$ longestSubSeq([36, 41, 56, 35, 91, 33, 34, 92, 43, 37, 42])
$ 5 // 36, 35, 33, 34, 37
```
