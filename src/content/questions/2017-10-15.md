## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you build a queue in the language of your choice.  A few people sent me their implementations; here's one from Kyle Hodgetts in Go!

Here's my implementation in JavaScript:

```
function Queue() {
  this.q = [];

  this.peek = function() {
    return this.q[0];
  }
```
