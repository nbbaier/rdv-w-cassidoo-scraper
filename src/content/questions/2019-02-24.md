 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week I had y'all remove an element from an array to make its sum odd, and we got a bunch of great responses! Nice work Karthik, Stuart, Hank, and as always, Kyle! It was fun seeing this problem solved in so many different languages! Michael also emailed his in:

def removeForOdd(arr)\
first\_odd =-1\
sum = 0\
arr.each\_index { |x|\
sum += arr\[x]\
\# next loop if we found the odd already\
next if first\_odd >= 0\
first\_odd = x if arr\[x].odd?\
}

return -1 if sum.odd?\
return -1 if first\_odd == -1 # no odds\
\# if the two above don’t return then\
\# we are even and have identified the first\
\# odd so return that index\
first\_odd\
end

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes in a string of integers and returns all possible letter combinations you could create with them by mapping the digits to the letters according to a phone dial pad.**
