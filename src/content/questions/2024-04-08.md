## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you add unique values together! There were a TON of cool responses to this one. Great work Arban, Saad, Leo, Sebastián, Ricardo, Stephen, Noe, Joel, Kyle, Altamish, Muhammad, Chase, Angelo, Austin, Daryl, Jen, Amine, Varenya, Pedro, Raph, Youssef, Lucien, Dawood, Nathael, Farzad, Avanika, Ten, standin\_perseus, Noah, Mitchell, and Sean!

This week's question:\
**Imagine you have `n` dice, and each die has `m` faces on it (so the numbers are from 1 to `m`). Write a function where, given an integer `target`, it returns the number of possible ways to roll the dice to get the sum of `target` face up.** You can safely assume `m` will never be larger than 20 (so you don't have to deal with mega huge numbers).

Example:

```
let n = 1;
let m = 6;

$ diceSum(n,m,3)
$ 1 // there is only one die, and one way to get 3

$ diceSum(2,m,7)
$ 6 // 6 ways to get a sum of 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1
```
