## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make sure monsters in a line were safe! Thanks for playing Miguel, Winnie, David, Jonathan, Josh, Diego, Elke, Tenzy, Austin, Nico, Kriszti, Nick, Sameer, Tarang, Martijn, Ricardo, and Laasya!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of audio file durations, write a function to group the files into playlists such that each playlist's total duration does not exceed a given limit `maxDuration`. Return an array of playlists, where each playlist is an array of file durations.** Try to minimize the number of playlists.

Example:

```
const files = [120, 90, 60, 150, 80];
const maxDuration = 200;

groupAudioFiles(files, maxDuration)
> [[150], [120,80], [90,60]]

groupAudioFiles(files, 160)
> [[150], [120], [90,60], [80]]
```
