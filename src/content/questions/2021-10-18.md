## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out if a number is "odious" or not. Awesome work Griffin, Gabor, Ben, Les, Phillip, Maaz, Taylor, Andy, Jesper, David, Sreetam, Lucas, Leyan, Md, Deepak, Ten, Zoe, Glenn, Neil, Rafael, Tamas, Andy, Rob, Ivana, and Tania!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of objects A, and an array of indexes B, reorder the objects in array A with the given indexes in array B.**

Example:

```
let a = [C, D, E, F, G, H];
let b = [3, 0, 4, 1, 2, 5];

$ reorder(a, b) // a is now [D, F, G, C, E, H]
```
