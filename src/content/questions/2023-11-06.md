## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you rearrange some digits. It was a weird one and y'all did great Miguel, 413, Saad, Jonnie, Martin, Andy, Fraol, Neil, Altamish, Don, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given a list of words and a dictionary of letter scores, find the word with the highest score according to the rules: `score = word_length * (sum of letter scores in the word)`.** If there are multiple words with the same highest score, return the lexicographically smallest one.

Example:

```
const wordList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig"];

const letterScores = [...Array(26).keys()].reduce((scores, i) => (scores[String.fromCharCode(97 + i)] = i + 1, scores), {});
// This produces { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, ... }

scoreWordGame(wordList, letterScores)
// 'cherry'
```
