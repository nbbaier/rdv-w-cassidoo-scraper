## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you implement a function that checked if an input is a factorial. Great job Becker, Ivana, Katherine, Ten, Sophie, Jesse, Jehiel, Nwosa, Denis, Gamal, Oswaldo, Michael, Klára, Samy, Austin, Joel, Hunter, Jose, Qais, Dimitris, Carlo, Leslie, Uzair, and Rubén!

This week’s question is a puzzler!\
**Write a function that prints “Hello, world!” but doesn’t repeat any characters in the program.**\
The program should not use *any* character more than once (except whitespace, I’ll allow that)!
