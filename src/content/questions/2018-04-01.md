 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you reverse the diagonals in an n\*n array. Here's Will's solution!

This week's question:\
**Given a matrix of 0s and 1s, where 0s are bodies of water and 1s are bodies of land, return the number of land masses. Land is connected horizontally and/or vertically.**

Example:\
\[\
\[0,1,1,1],\
\[0,0,0,1]\
\[1,0.1.0]\
\[0,0,1,1]\
]\
\> 3 bodies of land

Bonus points: Do this without allocating extra memory!

She says: "Please do."\
The man clears his throat and says: "Plethora."\
The widow replies: "Thank you, that means a lot."
