## Interview question of the week

Got some answers to this past week's question directly in my inbox, which was so nice to see. If you'd like me to feature your answer, please stick it in a tweet or a gist so I can credit you! That being said, Thomas Vaeth wrote a great solution to last week's question!

This week's question:\
**Given an unsorted array arr, find the minimum difference between any pair in arr.**

Example:\
\> minimumDiff(\[130, 5, 20, 9])\
\> 4
