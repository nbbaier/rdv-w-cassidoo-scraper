 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you take a given an integer array and two numbers x and y, print x numbers from the array, such that difference between any two pairs is divisible by y. If there were no x numbers, then you'd print -1.

I didn't have time to write my own solution for this one this week (see previous section for why), but here's a solution I found online for ya!

And here's this week's question!

**Write a multiply function in JavaScript which will produce the following outputs when invoked:**

```
console.log(mul(2)(3)(4)); // output: 24 
console.log(mul(4)(3)(4)); // output: 48
```

## Joke

I saw a post on Craigslist that said: Radio for sale, $1. Volume knob stuck on full.\
I thought to myself, I can't turn that down!
