## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the intersection between two lists. This was a toughie! Great job Gülşah, Miguel, Eric, Ryan, Jagadish, Lucien, Aodhan, Nathan, Dan, Saad, Karla, Nicole, Don, Hristiyan, Ivana, Constant, Amine, Olumide, Ten, and Hristiyan!

This week's question:\
**Given an integer `n`, count the total number of `1` digits appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`.**

Example:

```
> numberOfOnes(14)
> 7 // 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
```
