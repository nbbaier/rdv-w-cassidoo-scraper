## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make and print a binary tree! These kinds of questions are always tough, great work Amine, Leyan, Nathael, Neil, Faith, Ryan, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Write a function called `daysBetween` that takes in two dates, and returns the number of days between those dates.** You can choose the date format you'd like to accept!

Example:

```
> daysBetween('Jan 1, 2024', 'Jan 29, 2024')
> 28

> daysBetween('Feb 29, 2020', 'Oct 31, 2023')
> 1340
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on LinkedIn, Twitter, Mastodon, or Bluesky)
