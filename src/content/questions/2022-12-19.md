## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find and sum rectangles in a 2D array! Great job Ten, Daniel, Saad, and Max!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string, make every consonant after a vowel uppercase.** Can you do this with and without regex?

Example:

```
> capitalAfterVowel("hello world")
> "heLlo WoRld"

> capitalAfterVowel("xaabeuekadii")
> "xaaBeueKaDii"
```
