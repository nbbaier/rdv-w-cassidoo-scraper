## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you validate chess moves. This was a tough one! Nice job Krem, Max, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**The Settlers of Catan board game has 18 number hexes (two each of 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and one each of 2 and 12), and one desert hex in a large hexagon formation. Generate a valid randomized Catan board in which 6s and 8s cannot touch each other.**

Examples of valid boards:

```
// These use A B C for 10 11 12, respectively, and . for the empty desert hex.

  B 9 A
 5 6 C 8
6 4 B 5 3
 2 8 9 3
  A . 4

  B B C
 3 A 3 A
2 4 6 . 6
 4 5 9 9
  8 5 8

  6 3 8
 2 4 5 A
5 9 . 6 9
 A B 3 C
  8 4 B
```
