## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you roll some dice to meet a sum! Great work Arban, Amine, John, Saad, Pozorvlak, Dan, Ten, Kyle, Alison, The Math Jester, and Nathael!

This week's question:\
**Given a string `str`, write a function to determine the longest substring containing only two unique characters.**

Example:

```
> uniqueSubstr('eceba')
> 3 // "ece"

> uniqueSubstr('ccaabbb')
> 5 // "aabbb"

> uniqueSubstr('abcabcabc')
> 2 // "ab", "bc", or "ca"
```
