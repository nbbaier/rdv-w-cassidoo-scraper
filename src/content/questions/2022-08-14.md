## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you swap every two adjacent nodes. There were some clever answers! Great job Aodhan, dvkr, Lucia, Shannon, Jun, Amine, Miguel, Nicky, Lily, Saad, Mazen, Jack, Ngoako, Ten, Eric, Nicole, Muhammad, Chuan, Rafael, Jack, Kelvin, Don, and Chase!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string `s` consisting of various parenthesis `(` and `)`, find the length of the longest valid parenthesis substring.**

Example:

```
> parensSubstring('(()(')
> 2

> parensSubstring(')()(()))')
> 6
```
