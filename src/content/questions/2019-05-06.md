## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you make a "click outside detector" in whatever language you wanted. Rebecca wrote an awesome  Android solution, and Stuart made a web one!

This week's question:\
**Write a function where given n, it returns the angles at each point of a star with n points.**

Hint: The sum of the angles at each point of a 5 pointed star is 180 degrees, and at a 6 pointed is 360 degrees.
