## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find an array of maximums. Great job Matteo, Daniel, Jack, Karey, Phillip, Dan, Ben, Kelvin, Leyan, Johannes, Amine, Gabor, Olumide, Dan, Giovanni, Hristiyan, Divyansh, Wayne, Phil, Les, Gülşah, Enrique, Rafael, Chin, Will, Ten, Joe, Jorge, and Don!

This week’s question:\
**Given an `n` x `m` matrix where all of the units are 0s except for an `1` for “start”, a `2` for “end”, and `3` s for walls, find the shortest paths that you can take to get from `1` to `2`, while working around `3` s.**

Example:

```
let grid = [
[1,0,0],
[0,0,2]
]

let grid2 = [
[1,3,0],
[0,0,2]
]

$ startToEnd(grid)
$ [['right', 'right', 'down'], ['right', 'down', 'right'], ['down', 'right', 'right']]

$ startToEnd(grid2)
$ [['down', 'right', 'right']]
```
