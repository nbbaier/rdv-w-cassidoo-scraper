 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given an `n` x `m` matrix where all of the units are 0s except for an `1` for “start”, a `2` for “end”, and `3` s for walls, find the shortest paths that you can take to get from `1` to `2`, while working around `3` s.**

Example:

```
let grid = [
[1,0,0],
[0,0,2]
]

let grid2 = [
[1,3,0],
[0,0,2]
]

$ startToEnd(grid)
$ [['right', 'right', 'down'], ['right', 'down', 'right'], ['down', 'right', 'right']]

$ startToEnd(grid2)
$ [['down', 'right', 'right']]
```
