 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I asked you a non-coding question: Would you continue to contribute to an open-source project if you found out that it was being used for some projects that contradict your personal values?\
Here's some of your answers:

* "It fully depends on the type of open-source project and what its objective is--if its main use case goes against my values, I would stop contributing to it. On the other hand, if it happens to be such a broad-use project that some projects that use it go against my values, all I would do is express my disgust at it."
* "For me this dilemma is the 21st century of Voltaire's old adage: "I wholly disapprove of what you say and will defend to the death your right to say it." I would continue to contribute to the project if it is meaningful to me, both for what it is (technically speaking), for the way I personally benefit from its existence, and sure, I would keep an eye on who else is using it. Those usages I personally disagree with, I would report to the authorities if they seem to be unlawful, the rest I would live with. Finally I would advocate its use for initiatives that are in line with my personal values, in order to incentivize the "good" use of the project."
* "Yes. Full stop, no buts, and no caveats."
* "Honestly I probably would stop. I contribute to open source when I believe in it, and if it goes against what I believe, then I can always move on to another project."
