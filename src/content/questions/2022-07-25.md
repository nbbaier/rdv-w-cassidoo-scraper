 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given two arrays `A` and `B`, return the indices at which the two arrays intersect. If the two arrays have no intersection at all, return `null`.** Extra credit: how would you change your code if they were linked lists instead of arrays, if the input were the two head nodes, and you returned the intersection node?

Example:

```
let listA = [1,4,5,6]
let listB = [2,3,4,5,6]

> findIntersection(listA, listB)
> [1, 2]
```

(see this diagram if it helps you visualize it)
