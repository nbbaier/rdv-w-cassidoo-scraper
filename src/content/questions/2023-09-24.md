## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you build a staircase!

This week's question:\
**Using the PokéAPI (or your own local setup) write a function that takes in a Pokémon `type`, and returns what that type is weak against, and strong against.**&#x48;ere is the listing of types and here's an example JSON for the `fighting` type!

Example:

```
> typeMatchup('fighting')
> "Weak against flying, psychic, and fairy. Strong against normal, rock, steel, ice, and dark."

> typeMatchup('cassidy')
> "This is not a valid Pokémon type, she's weak against everything."
// You can put whatever you want in this response, heh.
```
