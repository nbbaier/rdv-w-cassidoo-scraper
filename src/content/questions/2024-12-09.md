## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you help Santa with his roll call! Ho ho ho Andreas, Ender, droffilcasepam, Marco, David, Ten, Ashish, Austin, Kyle, Ross, Muhammad, Miguel, Diego, Alison, Jeremias, Amine, Vasanth, Ricardo, Kriszti, Chase, Phillip, and Lenny!

This week's question:\
**Write a function `wrapGifts` that finds the maximum number of gifts that can be wrapped using a single strip of wrapping paper of a given width. Each gift has a specific length, and you can only wrap gifts if their total length fits within the paper width without cutting the paper.**

Example:

```
wrapGifts([2, 3, 4, 5], 7)
2 // either gifts 2 and 5, or 3 and 4.

wrapGifts([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 3)
3

wrapGifts([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)
3 // 1 and 2 and 3
```
