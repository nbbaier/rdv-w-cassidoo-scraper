## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return a subarray with a minimum sum. You did great Julian, Miguel, Varenya, Charles, Jonnie, Bhavesh, Usman, Leo, Towseef, Sreetam, Anirudh, Karthick, Chase, Leyan, Martin, Muhammad, Ten, Neil, Chin, Alison, Max, Lawal, and Clifford!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of integers, sort them into two separate sorted arrays of even and odd numbers.** If you see a zero, skip it.

Example:

```
> separateAndSort([4,3,2,1,5,7,8,9])
> [[2,4,6], [1,3,5,7,9]]

> separateAndSort([1,1,1,1])
> [[], [1,1,1,1]]
```
