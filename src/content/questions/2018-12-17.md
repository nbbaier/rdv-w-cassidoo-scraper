## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you reverse words in a string (except for the first and last word)! We had a bunch of great answers. Here's Kyle's, Wesley's, and Rodrigo's!

Joe's Python answer:\
def revMid(s):\
li = s.split()\
for i in range(1, len(li) - 1):\
li\[i] = li\[i]\[::-1]\
return ' '.join(li)

and Sumaiya's Python answer!\
example1 = "I want some cake"\
example1 = example1.split(' ')

def reverse(word):\
tempList = \[]\
index = len(word) - 1\
for char in word:\
tempList.append(word\[index])\
index -= 1\
separator = ''\
return separator.join(tempList)

def reverse\_middle(example):\
last = len(example) - 1\
for word in example1:\
if word == example1\[0] or word == example1\[last]:\
print(word, end= ' ')\
else:\
print(reverse(word= word), end=' ')

reverse\_middle(example= example1)

This week's question:\
**Given a binary string, write a function that is allowed to do at most one swap between any 0 and 1 to find the length of the longest consecutive 1's that can be achieved.**

Example:\
binarySwap(' 111011101')\
\> 7\
(Swap the 0 at index 4 with 1 at index 10)

binarySwap('000111')\
\> 3\
(No swaps needed)
