## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return possible sentences with a given string and dictionary. Awesome work Leyan, Ashleigh, Elliot, Luciano, Leslie, Brendon, Stefi, Steve, Christos, Alex, Chia, Ten, and Ivana!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string `str` containing only the characters `x` and `y`, change it into a string such that there are no matching adjacent characters. You’re allowed to delete zero or more characters in the string. Find the minimum number of required deletions.**

Example:

```
$ everyOther('xxyxxy')
$ 2 // str becomes 'xyxy'

$ everyOther('yyyyy')
$ 4 // str becomes 'y'
```
