## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a program for a laundromat. I got a fun response from Dimitris written in Scratch! Thought it was a really clever use case.:)

This week's question:\
**Given an n\*n matrix (or 2D array) of elements, reverse the diagonals of that matrix.**

Example:\
diagreverse({1, 2, 3,\
4, 5, 6,\
7, 8, 9})\
\> {9, 2, 7,\
4, 5, 6,\
3, 8, 1}

Bonus: Do it for all types, not just integers.\
Double Bonus: Determine a way to do something similar for a matrix of n\*m elements.
