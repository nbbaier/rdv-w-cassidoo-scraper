## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find hills and valleys in an array! Y'all did great Altamish, Alexandra, Plamedi, Krzysztof, Arban, Jonnie, Amine, Dawood, Neil, Nathael, Saad, Sami, Ryan, Kyle, Avanika, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given a 2D array of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, return the size of the largest "island" in the water.** Diagonal connections don't count!

Example:

```
let map = [
[0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1],
[0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0],
]

> largestIsland(map)
> 7
```
