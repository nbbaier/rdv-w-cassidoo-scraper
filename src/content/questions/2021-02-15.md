## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a ProductList class with a couple methods. I loved seeing all of the new folks (and regulars, of course) joining in! Great job Nicolas, Ale, Leslie, Elliot, Anna, Amy, Vinicius, Tamás, Timotius, David, Ashleigh, Ilya, Dhanush, Artem, Jens, Eduardo, Vishwa, Sarabadu, Leyan, Vanessa, Jonathan, Michael, Halí, Alex, Damilare, Jake, Ten, Alisa, Matheus, Namrata, Alexandre, James, Ale, Clov, Ivana, Kyle, Steve, Ciarán, Brendon, and Nelo!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string `str` and a dictionary `dict` containing a list of non-empty words, add spaces in `str` to construct a “sentence” where each word is a valid word in `dict`. Return all possible sentences.** You are allowed to reuse the words in `dict`.

Example:

```
str = "penpineapplepenapple"
dict = ["apple", "pen", "applepen", "pine", "pineapple"]

$ makeSentence(str, dict)
$ [
    "pen pine apple pen apple",
    "pen pineapple pen apple",
    "pen pine applepen apple"
  ]
```
