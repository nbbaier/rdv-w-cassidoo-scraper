 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given a string `str` and a dictionary `dict` containing a list of non-empty words, add spaces in `str` to construct a “sentence” where each word is a valid word in `dict`. Return all possible sentences.** You are allowed to reuse the words in `dict`.

Example:

```
str = "penpineapplepenapple"
dict = ["apple", "pen", "applepen", "pine", "pineapple"]

$ makeSentence(str, dict)
$ [
    "pen pine apple pen apple",
    "pen pineapple pen apple",
    "pen pine applepen apple"
  ]
```
