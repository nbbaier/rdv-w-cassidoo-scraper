## Interview question of the week

Last week, I gave you a non-coding question and asked you to explain the difference between high- and low-level programming languages. Dimitris and Sophie came up with great responses!

This week's question:\
**Given N number of dice with F number of faces each (numbered from 1 to F), find the number of ways to get a given sum X.**

Example:\
\> diceCombos(n = 2, f = 4, x = 4)\
\> 3 // (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
