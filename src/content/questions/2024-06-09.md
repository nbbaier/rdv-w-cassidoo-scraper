## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return sorted, even numbers! Y'all did this one in some funky ways and languages, I loved it. Awesome job Patrick, Clifford, Miguel, Muhammad, Altamish, Andy, Dayo, John, Danny, Alison, Dale, Sean, Azeez, Ross, Simon, Ricardo, Warren, Amine, Mazen, Stefan, Ten, and Dan!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes an array of integers and a target sum, and returns all unique quadruplets `[a, b, c, d]` in the array such that `a + b + c + d = target`.** If it's impossible, return an empty array.

Example:

```
> fourSum([1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], 0)
> [[-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0, 1]]

> fourSum([], 0)
> []

> fourSum([1, -2, -5, -4, -3, 3, 3, 5], -11)
> [[-5, -4, -3, 1]]
```
