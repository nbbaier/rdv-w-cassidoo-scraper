## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make an ASCII cube generator! Y'all wrote some COOL entries, they were so fun to go through!! Awesome job David, Ten, Muhammad, Neha, Austin, Winnie, Mario, and Uwe, definitely look through these.

This week's question:\
**Given two arrays, return all pairs (where each number is in each array) whose sum is an odd number.**

Examples:

```
oddSum([9, 14, 6, 2, 11], [8, 4, 7, 20])
> [9, 20], [14, 7], [11,8]

oddSum([2, 4, 6, 8], [10, 12, 14])
> null // (or whatever falsy value you prefer)
```
