 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together in separate arrays.** An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

Example:

```
$ groupAnagrams(["eat","tea","ten","poop","net","ate"])
$ [["poop"],["net","ten"],["eat","tea","ate"]]
```
