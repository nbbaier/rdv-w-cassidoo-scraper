## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you place scarecrows in a field! Do you know who *also* is outstanding in their field? Micah, Ten, Paul, David, Kaartic, Toni, Amine, and Dani!

This week's question:\
**Given he current position of a knight as `[row, col]` in an 8x8 chess board represented as a 2D array, write a function to return all valid moves the knight can make.** Extra credit: Do this for every chess piece!

Example:

```
knightMoves([4, 4])
> [[2, 3], [2, 5], [3, 2], [3, 6], [5, 2], [5, 6], [6, 3], [6, 5]]

knightMoves([0, 0])
> [[1, 2], [2, 1]]

knightMoves([1, 2])
> [[0, 0], [0, 4], [2, 0], [2, 4], [3, 1], [3, 3]]
```
