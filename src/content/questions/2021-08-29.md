## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you get the top OSS repos using a certain API. This was a toughie, great work Les, Ten, Craig, and Philip John, and Claude!

This week’s question:\
**Write a function to find the longest common prefix string in an array of strings.**

Example:

```
$ longestPrefix(["cranberry","crawfish","crap"])
$ "cra"

$ longestPrefix(["parrot", "poodle", "fish"])
$ ""
```
