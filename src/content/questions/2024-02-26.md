## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the maximum product of word lengths! Awesome work Varenya, Altamish, Maciej, Neil, Amos, Miguel, Ryan, Leandr, Junvic, Ten, Arban, Saad, Mitchell, Alison, Nathael, and Muhammad!

This week's question:\
**Given a number and a digit to remove from that number, maximize the resulting number after the digit has been removed and print it.** You can choose how you want to handle a digit not existing in the number.

Example:

```
> removeDigit(31415926, 1)
> 3415926 // we picked the second 1 in the number.

> removeDigit(1231, 1)
> 231 // 231 > 123
```
