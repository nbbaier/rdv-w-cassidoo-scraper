## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you sort integers based on the number of 1s in their binary representation. Amazing job Vanessa, William, Roman, Rafael, Roberto, Leslie, John, Jay, David, Clov, Rizwan, Sam, Nicolas, Timur, Dhanush, Andrew, Duncan, Lenz, Mike, Matteo, 40arc, Jeff, Jonathan, Randy, Bill, Pozorvlak, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**You have a character who jumps forward n number of units at a time, and an array representing the road in front of them (where 0 is a flat piece of road, and 1 is an obstacle). Return true or false if your character can jump to the end without hitting an obstacle in front of them.**

Examples:

```
$ characterJump(3, [0,1,0,0,0,1,0])
$ true // no hits

$ characterJump(4, [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0])
$ false // hits obstacle at position 4
```
