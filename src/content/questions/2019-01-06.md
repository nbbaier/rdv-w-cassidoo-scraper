## Interview question of the week

It's been a while since our last interview question! This one was asking for the greater of two powers, and Kyle and Mark had *great* answers!

**This week, I'm going to have you write out some answers to questions about pointers!**\
\- What is the difference between passing by value and passing by reference?\
\- How can pointers be used with inherited or abstract classes?\
\- What does it mean for a pointer to be null?\
\- What happens when you use the dereference operator (&) on a null pointer?
