 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

This past week, Daniel gave us a functional solution and Stuart an iterative one to the question of printing a spiral over a 2D matrix!

This week's question:\
**Given a number n, print out the numbers less than n that are both a perfect square and a perfect cube.**

Example:\
squareCubeNums(100)\
\> 1, 64

Bonus: Try to do this in less than 10 lines of code!

## Joke

I like to play chess with the old folks in the park.\
I admit it's hard to find 32 of them, though.
