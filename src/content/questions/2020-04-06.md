## Interview question of the week

Sophie Jonny Ten Jesse Sameer Axel Joseph Dimitris Denis Alejandro Jasper Jennifer Thanos Riana Nikos Herbert Collin Rishabh

**Given two strings n and m, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. The twist: # means a backspace character.**

```
> compareWithBackspace("a##c", "#a#c")
> true      // both strings become "c"

> compareWithBackspace("xy##", "z#w#")
> true      // both strings become ""
```
