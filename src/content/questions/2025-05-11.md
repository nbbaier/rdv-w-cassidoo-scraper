## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return string prefixes. I made some sleepy typos in the examples, thanks for your patience y'all! Anyway, good work Jeremias, ashuzon, David, Ten, Ramsés, Muhammad, Leo, Joey, Kracekumar, Kasia, Prashil, Elke, and Neha!

This week's question:\
**Given two integers `origin` and `target`, add operators in the `origin` number to make it equal `target`, if possible.** You can return just one, or all possibilities for this!

Examples:

```
> addOperators(123, 6)
> ["1*2*3", "1+2+3"]

> addOperators(3456237490, 9191)
> [] // none possible
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on Bluesky, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Mastodon)
