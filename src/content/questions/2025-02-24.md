## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you determine if a spaceship shield was safe. Pew pew good for you Amine, Ricardo, Jeremias, Miguel, Tim, Austin, Vanessa, Muhammad, Szymon, Saleh, Kyle, Ashish, David, Neha, Nwosa, Winnie, Ten, Max, and Ross!

This week's question:\
**Given a list of frequencies (in Hz), write a function to determine the closest musical note for each frequency based on the A440 pitch standard.** Extra credit: indicate if the note is flat or sharp!

Example:

```
> getNoteNames([440, 490, 524, 293.66])
> ["This is a A", "This is a B, but it's flat", "This is a C, but it's sharp", "This is a D"]
```
