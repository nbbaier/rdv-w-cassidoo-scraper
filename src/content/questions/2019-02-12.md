## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you explain functional programming! Kyle gave a great answer.

This week's question:\
**Given a string, find the minimum number of characters to be inserted to convert it to palindrome.**

Example:\
makeAPal('hi')\
\> 1 // for ihi or hih\
makeAPal('xx')\
\> 0
