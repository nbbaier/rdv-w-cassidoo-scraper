## Interview question of the week

Last time, I asked you about repeated substrings! Sophie, Marcela, Abdullah, Moataz, Reuben, and Kyle submitted some great answers!

This week's question:\
**Let's say you have some special bags that can only hold up to 3kgs of weight. Given an array of integers (where each integer is between 1 and 3) that represent weights, determine how many bags you need to carry all of them.**

Examples:\
\> specialBag(\[1,1,3,2])\
\> 3 bags

\> specialBag(\[2,2,2,1,3,1])\
\> 4 bags

\> specialBag(\[1,1,1])\
\> 1 bag
