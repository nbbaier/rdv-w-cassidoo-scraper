## Joke

A 13 year old weasel walks into a bar and approaches the counter. The bartender immediately notices the underage weasel.\
“Sir, you look extremely young. I can’t serve you even a single beer.”\
“Oh c’mon. You can’t just slide me one?”\
“Can’t and will not serve to anyone under age.”\
“Fine. Well what other things do you have?”\
“Well for non-alcoholics I have tap water and bottled water, I have coffee, and I have pop. Which would you like?”\
“Pop.” Goes the weasel.
