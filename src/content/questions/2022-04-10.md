 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given an integer `n` representing the number of sides of a regular polygon, return the measure of each interior angle.** Bonus points: implement some of the other functions listed in the linked Wikipedia page!

Example:

```
$ interiorAngleSize(3)
$ 60 // Each angle in a triangle that is a regular polygon is 60 degrees

$ interiorAngleSize(8)
$ 135
```
