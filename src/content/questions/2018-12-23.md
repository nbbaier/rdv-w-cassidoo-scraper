## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you swap binary digits to make the longest string of 1s possible. Nathan did an awesome Twitter thread walkthrough of his solution! Mark also wrote a nice solution!

This week's question:\
**Given two numbers a and b, determine if a^b or b^a is greater, and return which is greater. Twist: You can't use Math.pow (or whatever exponent function that's built-in to your language of choice).**

Example:\
greaterPow(3, 5)\
\> a^b is greater

greaterPow(2, 4)\
\> Both are equal
