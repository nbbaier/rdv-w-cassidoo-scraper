## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out NFL uniform numbers! Awesome work Muhammad, Nwosa, Ricardo, Neha, Ten, Tim, Saleh, and Pat!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of attack damages and a shield capacity for a spaceship, return the index when cumulative damage exceeds the shield.** Return -1 if shield survives.

Example:

```
> findShieldBreak([10, 20, 30, 40], 50)
> 2

> findShieldBreak([1, 2, 3, 4], 20)
> -1

> findShieldBreak([50], 30)
> 0
```
