 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last time, I had you write a square root function! Sophie, Dimitris, Stuart, Jehiel, Kyle, and  rhalyjon did a great job answering!

This week's question:\
**Given an integer n, write a function to count all possible sequences of length n such that all the elements of the sequence are in the range \[1 to n] and the sum of the elements of the sequence is even.**

Example:\
countEvenSequences(3)\
\> 13\
// All possible sequences of length 3 will be (1, 1, 2), (1, 3, 2),\
// (3, 1, 2), (3, 3, 2), (1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 3), (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 3),\
// (2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (2, 3, 3) and (2, 2, 2).

The answer can get large, so be efficient with this one!
