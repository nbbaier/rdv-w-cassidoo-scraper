 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a palindrome! Dimitris, Andres, and Kyle gave great answers.:)

This week's question:\
**Given an array of integers, return the index of the first value you should remove to make the array sum an odd number (return -1 if sum is already odd or if it's impossible).**

Example:\
\> removeForOdd(\[2,4,6,7,8])\
\> -1\
\> removeForOdd(\[4,4,4])\
\> -1\
\> removeForOdd(\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7])\
\> 0
