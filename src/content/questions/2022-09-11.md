 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Remember the bouncing DVD logo? Given the dimensions of the logo, its initial coordinates, and the size of a screen, write a function that will determine if its next collision will hit the corner of the screen.** Assume it is initially moving southeast with a slope of -1. Extra credit, figure out how many bounces/collisions it will take to hit a corner!

Example:

```
let dimensions = [5,5]
let initialCoordinates = [0,0] // you decide which part of the logo the coords map to
let screenSize = [100,100]

> cornerHit(dimensions, initialCoordinates, screenSize)
> true // in one collision

> cornerHit(dimensions, [45,70], [400,200])
> false
```
