## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a generator that produces values in a range. This was a tricky one and there were some super interesting answers! Awesome work Aodhan, Gabor, dvkr, Stephen, Zoé, Claude, Manuel, Les, Jack, Ezequiel, Miguel, Mazen, Liam, Robin, Muhammad, Leyan, Saad, Dani, Amine, Tamás, Lucien, Will, Ten, Chase, Ryan, Ollie, Max, and Mo!

This week's question:\
**Remember the bouncing DVD logo? Given the dimensions of the logo, its initial coordinates, and the size of a screen, write a function that will determine if its next collision will hit the corner of the screen.** Assume it is initially moving southeast with a slope of -1. Extra credit, figure out how many bounces/collisions it will take to hit a corner!

Example:

```
let dimensions = [5,5]
let initialCoordinates = [0,0] // you decide which part of the logo the coords map to
let screenSize = [100,100]

> cornerHit(dimensions, initialCoordinates, screenSize)
> true // in one collision

> cornerHit(dimensions, [45,70], [400,200])
> false
```
