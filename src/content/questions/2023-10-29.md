## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you delete characters to make palindromes. Good work Saad, Augustin, Jonnie, Sreetam, Miguel, Laurynas, Tawseef, Martin, Frederik, Ten, Neil, Andy, and Don!

This week's question:\
**Given a number, rearrange its digits to make it the next larger number.** So not the maximum size it can be, but the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers!

Example:

```
> lexoNext(123)
> 132

> lexoNext(314159)
> 314195
```
