 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

This past week we had a TON of responses to the missing integers problem! Nice work Laurent, Gabriela, Amanda, Ilya, Gabriel, Thomas, Matthew, Jenny, Garth, Adam, Will, Mustafa, Endy, Ellie, Nikita, Ethan, Arkady, Kyle, and  Ryan!

Here's a harder one for you this week:\
**Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path can start and end at any node in the tree.**

Example:\
I drew a diagram of a tree here for an easy visual!\
For this tree, maxPathSum would return 43 (the result of the path 20 + 3 + 10 + 10).
