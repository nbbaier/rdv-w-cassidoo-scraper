## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you generate permutations of a string! Y'all did a great job on this Ashish, Amine, Muhammad, Filip, Andrew, Kyle, Hendrik, Sreetam, Ten, Shreya, Neha, and Ricardo!

This week's question:\
**Make a translation function for the NATO phonetic alphabet.** Extra credit: Get creative with the variants!

Example:

```
> natoify('hello world')
> "Hotel Echo Lima Lima Oscar (space) Whiskey Oscar Romeo Lima Delta"

> natoify('3spooky5me')
> "Three Sierra Papa Oscar Oscar Kilo Yankee Five Mike Echo"
```
