## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return the longest palindromic substring in a given string. Great work Deepak, David, Craig, Mark, Ten, Alex, Ann, Les, Jesper, Leyan, Gabor, Will, and Claude!

This week’s question:\
**You need to get the top 5 GitHub OSS code repositories that make use of the `navigator.sendBeacon` Web API. How would you go about it?** Get creative!

This week’s question is brought to you by Sourcegraph! Sourcegraph makes it easier to search, discover, and understand open source projects.
