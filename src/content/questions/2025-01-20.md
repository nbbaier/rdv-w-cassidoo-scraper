## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a translation function for the NATO phonetic alphabet! It was fun seeing how similar (and different) your answers were. Great job Ross, Will, Ashish, Ten, Muhammad, Trevor, Kyle, Óscar, Tim, Neha, Shreya, Alison, Vincent, Kriszti, Ricardo, Bruna, Mazen, Kracekumar, Belkin, Hugo, Winnie, and Amine!

This week's question:\
**Given a list of integers, write a function that finds the longest subsequence where the difference between consecutive elements is either 1 or -1. Return the length of this subsequence.**

Examples:

```
> longestSubsequence([1,2,3,4,5])
5
> longestSubsequence([4,2,3,1,5])
2
> longestSubsequence([10,11,7,8,9,12])
3
```
