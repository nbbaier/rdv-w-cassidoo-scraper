## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you get piano key intervals! Awesome job Jesper, Ten, Muhammad, Neha, Ian, Murtala, and Ricardo!

This week's question:\
**Write a function `scoreHand(cards)` that calculates the total score of a Cribbage hand. The input is an array of 5 card strings (including the starter card), where each card is represented as rank+suit (e.g., "AH", "10D", "KS").** Here are the scoring rules:

* 15s: 2 points for each combination of cards summing to 15
* Pairs: 2 points for each pair of same-rank cards
* Runs: 1 point per card in a run of 3 or more consecutive ranks

Example:

```
> scoreHand(["7H", "8C", "9D", "JH", "KS"])
> 5

> scoreHand(["AH", "2C", "3D", "4S", "5H"])
> 7
```
