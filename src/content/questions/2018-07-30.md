## Interview question of the week

We had a solid showing of responses this week for removing leading zeros! Boom bang boing bloop. Click those words to get the scoop.

Also, Andrew emailed this one-liner in:\
const removeLeading = (arr) => arr.reduce((acc, curr) => (!acc.length &&!curr? \[]: \[...acc, curr]));

This week's question:\
**Write a function that merges n sorted arrays.**

Example:\
arr\[]\[] = \[ \[1, 3], \[2, 4, 5], \[0, 9, 10, 11] ];\
\> mergeN(arr)\
\> 0 1 2 3 4 5 9 10 11
