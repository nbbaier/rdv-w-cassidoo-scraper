 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I made a mistake in the solution for the problem (it should have been 44, not 45). Sorry about that to anyone who tried it out!

I also got a request for solutions to the previous week's problem. Ask and you shall receive!

```
function seatsInTheater(nCols, nRows, col, row) {
   var min = ((nCols - col + 1) * (nRows - row)) + (nCols - col);
   var o = col * (nRows - row) + (col - 1);
   if (o < min) min = o;
   return min;
}
```

This week's question:\
**Write a function duplicate that takes in an array arr and an int n, and returns an array that duplicates arr n times.**

Example:

```
> duplicate([1,2,3,4,5], 2); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```

## Joke

Edgar Allen Poe is about to walk into a tree and you only have enough time to say one word before he hits it. What should you say to him?

Poetry!
