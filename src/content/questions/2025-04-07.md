## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find gaps in timestamps! Tick tock, you rock John, Taylor, Andy, Ben, Mike, Mazen, Nick, David, Muhammad, Roodz, Andrea, Ten, Huyixi, Elke, Austin, Miguel, Ben, Neha, Murtala, Levi, Saleh, Saravana, and Ross!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that returns the first `n` Leyland numbers in ascending order.** A Leyland number is defined as `x^y + y^x` for integers `x > 1` and `y > 1`.

Examples:

```
getLeylandNumbers(1)
[8]

getLeylandNumbers(5)
[8, 17, 32, 54, 57]
```
