 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given a list of Point objects (where a Point object has a name, and a list of names it is connected to), a starting Point object, and an ending Point object, return a possible path between the two Points.** If there are multiple paths, return the shortest one. If there is no path, return “no path”.

Example:

```
listOfPoints = [
  { name: "A", connections: ["B", "C"] },
  { name: "B", connections: ["A", "E"] },
  { name: "C", connections: ["A", "D"] },
  { name: "D", connections: ["C"] },
  { name: "E", connections: ["B", "F"] },
  { name: "F", connections: ["E"] },
]

$ pathBetweenPoints(listOfPoints, "A", "F")
$ A -> B -> E -> F

$ pathBetweenPoints(listOfPoints, "D", "B")
$ D -> C -> A -> B
```
