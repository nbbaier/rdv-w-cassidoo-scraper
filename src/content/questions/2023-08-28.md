## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a guessing game! There's some really creative answers, awesome work Rob, Karthick, Jonnie, Adnan, Usman, Clifford, Cicero, Dimitris, Miguel, Kyle, Anirban, Towseef, Neil, Laurynas, Alvin, Manuel, Andrew, Raymond, Craig, Alison, Chris, Sreetam, Ten, and Phil!

This week's question:\
**Given a sequence of numbers, generate a "count and say" string.**

Example:

```
> countAndSay(112222555)
> "two 1s, then four 2s, then three 5s"

> countAndSay(3333333333)
> "ten 3s"
```
