 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you look into train schedules and determining a number of train tracks based on that schedule. Stuart had a great answer to that!

This week's question:\
**Given three numbers that represent lengths of sides of a triangle, determine if the triangle is valid or not.**

\> validTriangle(60, 80, 40)\
\> true

\> validTriangle(5, 5, 50)\
\> false

## Joke

I called in to work and I said "I can't come in today, I have a wee cough."\
My boss answered, "You have a wee cough?"\
And I replied, "Wow, thanks boss, see you next Wednesday!"
