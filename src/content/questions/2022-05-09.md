 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**You went on a vacation with friends. Each of you paid for certain meals on the trip for the group. Write a function that determines who owes money to whom so that everyone pays equally.**

Example:

```
let receipts = [
  { name: 'Ximena', paid: 45 },
  { name: 'Clara', paid: 130 },
  { name: 'Ximena', paid: 100 },
  { name: 'Cassidy', paid: 140 },
  { name: 'Cassidy', paid: 76 },
  { name: 'Clara', paid: 29 },
  { name: 'Ximena', paid: 20 },
]

$ whoOwes(receipts)
$ 'Clara owes Cassidy $21, Ximena owes Cassidy $15'
```
