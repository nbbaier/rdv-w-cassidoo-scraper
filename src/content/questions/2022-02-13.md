 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given a QWERTY keyboard grid and a remote control with arrows and a “select” button, write a function that returns the buttons you have to press to type a certain word.** The cursor will always start in the upper left at the letter Q.

Example:

```
$ remoteControl('car')
$ 'down, down, right, right, select, left, left, up, select, up, right, right, right, select'
```
