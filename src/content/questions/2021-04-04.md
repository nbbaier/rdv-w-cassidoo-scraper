## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return true if a string represented a valid number. Good work Karey, Taylor, Nate, Zak, Luciano, David, Jean-François, Dhanush, Steve, Leyan, Caroline, Elliot, Jay, Oana, Sam, José, Clov, Kartik, Mark, Leslie, Ren, Dym, Max, Ivana, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given an integer `n` and a sorted array of prime integers called `primes`, return the nth “super ugly number”.** A “super ugly number” is a positive number whose all prime factors are in the array primes.

Example:

```
$ superUgly(1, [2,3,5])
$ 1
$ superUgly(11, [2,7,13,19])
$ 28
```
