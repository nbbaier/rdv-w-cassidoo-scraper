 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given an integer `n` and a sorted array of prime integers called `primes`, return the nth “super ugly number”.** A “super ugly number” is a positive number whose all prime factors are in the array primes.

Example:

```
$ superUgly(1, [2,3,5])
$ 1
$ superUgly(11, [2,7,13,19])
$ 28
```
