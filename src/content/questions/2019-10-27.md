## Interview question of the week

We had a ton of responses last week! I had you  find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. Sreetam, Gabriel, Stuart, Lauren, Daniel, Sabique, Matt, Ilya, Andrew, uzepar, and Steven did a great job in various languages!

This week's question:\
**Given a list of ordered integers with some of the numbers missing (and with possible duplicates), find the missing numbers.**

Example:\
\> missingInts(\[1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6])\
\> 2, 4

\> missingInts(\[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, 7])\
\> 5, 6
