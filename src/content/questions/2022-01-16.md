## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return a list of permutations of a string. Great work Leyan, Ten, Ben, Will, Zoe, Rafael, Les, Peter, Laryssa, Michael, Don, and Claude!

This week’s question is sponsored by Sourcegraph!\
**Using the rules of Wordle, given a guessWord and a solutionWord, return a set of emojis returned from the guessWord.**

Example:

```
let solutionWord = "fudge"

$ wordleGuess("reads", solutionWord)
$ "⬛🟨⬛🟨⬛"

$ wordleGuess("lodge", solutionWord)
$ "⬛⬛🟩🟩🟩"
```
