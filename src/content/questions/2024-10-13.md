## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the missing ingredients in recipes! Great work Mike, Kyle, Kostas, Alison, Ricardo, Muhammad, Connor, Amine, Schalk, Nick, Jeremias, Josh, nichoth, Ten, and Ashish!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that generates a valid SVG string for a circle given its radius, center position, and color.**

Examples:

```
generateCircle(radius = 50, center = (100, 100), color = "blue")
"<svg width='200' height='200'><circle cx='100' cy='100' r='50' fill='blue'/>svg>"

generateCircle(radius = 30, center = (75, 50), color = "red")
"<svg width='150' height='100'><circle cx='75' cy='50' r='30' fill='red'/>svg>"
```
