## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return true if an integer is a perfect square. Great job Alexandra, Ivana, Sam, Lakshay, Dimitris, Sreetam, Roman, Mert, Jonathan, Amy, Leyan, Prakash, Rafael, Jay, Jesús, Ma, Angel, Jonah, Selcuk, John, Leslie, William, Ilya, Ten, and Pozorvlak!

This week’s question:\
**Given an array of integers and a target value, return the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to a target value.**

Examples:

```
$ arrayDiff([1, 2, 3, 4], 1)
$ 3 // 2 - 1 = 1, 3 - 2 = 1, and 4 - 3 = 1
```
