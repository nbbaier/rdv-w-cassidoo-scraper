## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you create a Fibonacci-like function. Awesome work Aodhan, Dan, Ten, Jean-François, Kelvin, Ryan, Chinar, Leyan, Miguel, Les, Daniel, Cedric, Muhammad, boatman, Saad, Mo, Robin, Gabor, Churchill, Amine, Max, Jon, Brian, Priya, and Chase!

This week’s question:\
**Write a function that truncates words in a string to length `n`.**

Example:

```
let n = 3

> truncate('never gonna give you up', n)
> 'nev gon giv you up'

> truncate('*hello* darkness, my ~old_friend', n)
> '*hel* dar, my ~old_fri'
```
