 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a function that takes in text, and returns a 2D array where the larger array is broken up by sentences, and the inner arrays are broken up by words.

Here's my solution:

```
function s(str) {
  let sentences = str.replace(/([.?!])\s*(?=[A-Z])/g, '$1~').split('~');
  let ret = [];
  sentences.forEach(r => {
    ret.push(r.split(" "));
  });
  return ret;
}
```

I got carried away with the regex after realizing that sentences can have numbers in them. So what this does is capture a punctuation mark, checks that a capital letter happens after it, and if so, it replaces it with a ~. Then I split the sentences based on the ~, and then split each of the words in the sentence by a space. Woo hoo!

This week's question:\
**Assume you are given an unsorted list of numbers where everything is duplicated twice except for one number. Find and return that one number! How many solutions can you think of?**

Example input:\
\[1,2,3,6,4,9,9,2,1,4,6]\
Example output:\
3
