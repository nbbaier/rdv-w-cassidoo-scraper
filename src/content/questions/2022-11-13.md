## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return anti-divisors! This was a tricky one (I think many of us learned that anti-divisors exist), but y’all did great! Awesome work Tamás, Andy, Will, Michell, Amine, Thomas, Max, Neriya, Jun, Saad, Ten, and Cedric!

This week’s question (thanks to Will for sharing it):\
**Given a list of strings `arr`, and a max size `n`, return a new list where the strings (from left to right) are joined together with a space, so that each new string is less than or equal to the max size.**

Examples:

```
> combineStrings(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"], 5)
> ["a b c", "d e f", "g"]

> combineStrings(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"], 12)
> ["a b c d e f", "g"]

> combineStrings(["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta", "epsilon"], 20)
> ["alpha beta gamma", "delta epsilon"]
```
