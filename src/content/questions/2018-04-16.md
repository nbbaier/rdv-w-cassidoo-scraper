## Interview question of the week

Got some great replies to last week's question about removing numbers greater than n in a list! Each of these words is a link to a solution.:)

This week's question:\
**Given a sentence, return the number of palindromes in that sentence.**

Examples:\
\> "Hannah eats an evil olive in her Honda Civic"\
\> 3

\> "Flee to me, remote elf!"\
\> 1
