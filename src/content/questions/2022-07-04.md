## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the longest word that was the subsequence of a set. This one was sneakily tricky! Great work Andrew, Robin, Les, Jack, Will, Wayne, Charles, Ten, Leyan, Saad, Ben, Becker, Amine, Miguel, Andros, Zoé, Augustin, Olumide, Don, Divyansh, Hristiyan, Nicole, and Patricio!

This week's question:\
**The game Rummikub has 106 tiles: 8 sets numbered 1-13, colored red, blue, black, and yellow, and two (2) "wildcard" tiles.\
Write two functions: one that creates a new player's tray of 14 tiles (repetitions allowed), and one that returns the valid sets from a given tray.** A set can be either 3 or 4 tiles of the same number (but all different colors), or it can be a "run" (which is three or more consecutive numbers all in the same color). The rules for Rummikub are here if you need more clarification!
