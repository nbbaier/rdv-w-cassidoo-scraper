## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make playlists with a certain duration! La la la good job Christian, Victor, Laasya, Paul, Elke, Ten, and David!

This week's question:\
**Write a generator function `createLaundryItem()` that returns an object representing a laundry item. This object should have a method `nextCycle()` which, when called, advances the item through a series of laundry cycles in order: "soak", "wash", "rinse", "spin", and "dry". After the final cycle, subsequent calls to `nextCycle()` should return "done".**

Example:

```
let towel = createLaundryItem();

console.log(towel.nextCycle()); // "soak"
console.log(towel.nextCycle()); // "wash"
console.log(towel.nextCycle()); // "rinse"
console.log(towel.nextCycle()); // "spin"
console.log(towel.nextCycle()); // "dry"
console.log(towel.nextCycle()); // "done"
console.log(towel.nextCycle()); // "done"
```
