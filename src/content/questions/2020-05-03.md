## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement a circular queue. This was a tougher one, but amazing job Samy, Dimitris, Daniel, Dan, Stefan, Jasper, Linda, Ten and Qian (love that you paired on this!), Sarah, and Jakob!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of only one row on a keyboard.**

Extra credit: Include the option for a user to pick the type of keyboard they are using (ANSI, ISO, etc)!

Example:

```
$ oneRow(['candy', 'doodle', 'pop', 'shield', 'lag', 'typewriter'])
$ ['pop', 'lag', 'typewriter']
```
