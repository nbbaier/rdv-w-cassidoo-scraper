## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you identify numbers as abundant, deficient, perfect, or amicable! YOU are the perfect ones, Sergio, Amine, Adam, George, Usman, Andrew, Pedro, Elke, David, Marco, Victor, Gavin, John, Jonathan, Neefertiti, Ten, and Paul!

This week's question:\
**Given the non-negative integer `n`, output the value of its hyperfactorial.** Don't worry about outputs exceeding your language's integer limit.

Examples:

```
> hyperfactorial(0)
> 1

> hyperfactorial(2)
> 4
> 
> hyperfactorial(3)
> 108

> hyperfactorial(7)
> 3319766398771200000
```
