## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out if two strings were isomorphic. Awesome work Usman, tlgreg, Sreetam, Altamish, Jonnie, Neil, Saad, Leyan, Tawseef, Daniel, Zoé, Philip, 413, Varenya, Altamish, Fraol, Ten, Matt, Rincon, Matt, Chris, and Martin!

This week's question:\
**Given a string `s`, you are allowed to delete at most `k` characters. Find if the string can be a palindrome after deleting at most `k` characters.**

Example:

```
> kPal('abcweca', 2)
> true

> kPal('acxcb', 1)
> false
```
