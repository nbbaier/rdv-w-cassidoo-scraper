## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make an HTML tag validator. Great work Pozorvlak, Rizwan, Roman, Jesse, Jay, William, Sameer, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given an integer array arr, sort the integers in arr in ascending order by the number of 1's in their binary representation and return the sorted array.**

Examples:

```
$ sortBits([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
$ [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
```
