## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you organize a task list! Great job Kirill, Chetan, Saad, Martin, 413, Miguel, Anirban, Karthick, Chase, Neil, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given a start number `a`, an ending number `b`, and a string `str` that can be "odd", "even", or "prime", return all of the numbers that are odd, even, or prime between `a` and `b`.**`a` will not always necessarily be less than `b`!

Example:

```
> betweenNums(3, 11, 'even')
> [4,6,8,10]

> betweenNums(15, 1, 'prime')
> [2,3,5,7,11,13]
```
