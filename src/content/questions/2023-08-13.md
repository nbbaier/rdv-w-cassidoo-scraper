## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement the Luhn algorithm! Great work Arjun, Jonnie, Ten, Neil, Sreetam, Miguel, Will, Saad, Alvin, Laurynas, Karthick, Christian, Clifford, Manuel, Craig, and Jason!

This week's question:\
**You have a faulty keyboard. Whenever you type a vowel on it (`a`,`e`,`i`,`o`,`u`,`y`), it reverses the string that you have written, instead of typing the character. Typing other characters works as expected. Given a string, return what will be on the screen after typing with your faulty keyboard.**

Example:

```
> faultyKeeb('string')
> 'rtsng'

> faultyKeeb('hello world!')
> 'w hllrld!'
```
