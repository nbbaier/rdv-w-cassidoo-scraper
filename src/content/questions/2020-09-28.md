## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out asteroid collisions. Great job Jay, Rizwan, Ali, Gabor, Rafael, Jagadish, Pozorvlak, Anthony, Mustafa, Tim, Max, Soma, William, Mike, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given an array of people objects (where each person has a name and a number of pizza slices they’re hungry for) and a number for the number of slices that the pizza can be sliced into, return the number of pizzas you need to buy.**

Example:

```
$ arr = [{ name: Joe, num: 9 }, { name: Cami, num: 3 }, { name: Cassidy, num: 4 }]
$ gimmePizza(arr, 8)
$ 2 // 16 slices needed, pizzas can be sliced into 8 pieces, so 2 pizzas should be ordered
```
