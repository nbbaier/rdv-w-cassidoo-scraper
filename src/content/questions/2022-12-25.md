## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you capitalize consonants after vowels! Great job Andrea, Ricardo, Saad, Don, Dan, Miguel, Les, Will, Dan, Chinar, Nate, Max, Kyle, Ángel, David, Mo, y0landi, Muhammad, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string of any length which contains only digits from 0 to 9, replace each consecutive run of the digit 0 with its length.**

Example:

```
> replaceZeros('1234500362000440')
> 1234523623441

> replaceZeros('123450036200044')
> 123452362344

> replaceZeros('000000000000')
> 12

> replaceZeros('123456789')
> 123456789
```
