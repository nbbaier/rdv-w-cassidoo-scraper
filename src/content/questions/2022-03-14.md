 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given a matrix of 0s and 1s where 1s represent a Tetris block, and a rotation direction, return the matrix with the block rotated once.** You can use this guide for a hint to the algorithm!

Example:

```
let grid = [
[0,1,0,0],
[0,1,1,1],
[0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0]
]

$ rotateTetromino(grid, 'clockwise')
$ [
[0,0,1,1],
[0,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0],
[0,0,0,0]
]
```
