## Interview question of the week

Last time, I asked you to determine if a number's digits were balanced. Kyle sent in a great answer!

This week's question:\
**Let's do a CSS question this time! Design a set of classes in which class.center-v vertically centers a child element,.center-h horizontally aligns a child element, and classes.top,.bottom,.left, and.right fix the child element to those respective sides of the parent. You decide how you'd like to prioritize and combine the classes!**

(Heads up, submissions in a CodePen link will be easiest to see for me, but you can submit it however you'd like!)
