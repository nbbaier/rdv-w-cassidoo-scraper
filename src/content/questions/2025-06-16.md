## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a state machine for a street light! Ready, set, go Winnie, Chris, Elke, Ten, David, Raymond, Miguel, Kriszti, Pedro, Muhammad, Renato, Austin, Tim, Neha, and Patrycja!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of strings representing the names of monarchs and their ordinal numbers, write a function that returns the list of names sorted first by name and then by their ordinal value (in Roman numerals), in ascending order.**

Example:

```
> sortMonarchs(["Louis IX", "Louis VIII", "Philip II", "Philip I"])
> ["Louis VIII", "Louis IX", "Philip I", "Philip II"]

> sortMonarchs(["George VI", "George V", "Elizabeth II", "Edward VIII"])
> ["Edward VIII", "Elizabeth II", "George V", "George VI"]
```
