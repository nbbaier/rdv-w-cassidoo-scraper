## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out how long it would take to make a mechanical keyboard! Click clack David, Colin, Elke, Jen, Ten, Sameer, Charles, Ender, Amine, and Paul!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of side lengths, write a function to determine they can form a hexagon with three side-length pairs (as in, three pairs of equal sides needed). Return `true` if possible.**

Examples:

```
canFormHexagon([2, 3, 8, 8, 2, 3])
> true

canFormHexagon([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
> false

canFormHexagon([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
> false
```
