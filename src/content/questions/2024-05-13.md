## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a "word wrapping" function! Awesome work Ryan, Louis, Leyan, Ten, Amine, Mazen, Sam, and John!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes in a list (of `length >= 3`) of numbers, and returns the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying any three integers from the list.**

Example:

```
> maxProduct([2, 4, 1, 3, -5, 6])
> 72 // 4*3*6
```
