 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given a 3x3, 2D array of integers, where every digit is between 0 and 9, *except* 7, find the minimum number of digits that must be replaced with 7s so that the sums of the numbers in each row and each column are the same.**

Example:

```
$ missingSevens([[9,4,3],[3,4,9],[4,8,4]])
$ 0

$ missingSevens([[1,5,2],[5,9,5],[6,5,3]])
$ 4

$ missingSevens([[3,9,6],[8,5,5],[8,4,0]])
$ 2
```
