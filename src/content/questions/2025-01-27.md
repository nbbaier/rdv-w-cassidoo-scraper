## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find subsequences with certain constraints. Good work Ten, Muhammad, David, Ricardo, Amine, Stephen, Kyle, Ashish, Mac, Jawara, Tim, Neha, Shreya, Mazen, and Alison!

This week's question:\
**Given two strings, `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p` 's anagrams in `s`.**

Examples:

```
findAnagrams("cbaebabacd", "abc")
> [0, 6]

findAnagrams("fish", "cake")
> []

findAnagrams("abab", "ab")
> [0, 1, 2]
```
