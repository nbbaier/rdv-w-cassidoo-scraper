## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you build something using the Swatch beat time! Andrew built a Spring Boot application (I didn't know what Spring Boot was, so that was cool to see), and Stuart built a small web app using CodePen for the first time (woo hoo)!

This week's question:\
**Write a "click outside detector" where given an object (whether it be a DOM node or some other visual thing), if a user clicks inside of it, nothing happens, but if they click outside of it, an event is triggered.**
