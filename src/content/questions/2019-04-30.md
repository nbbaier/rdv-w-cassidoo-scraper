 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you build something using the Swatch beat time! Andrew built a Spring Boot application (I didn't know what Spring Boot was, so that was cool to see), and Stuart built a small web app using CodePen for the first time (woo hoo)!

This week's question:\
**Write a "click outside detector" where given an object (whether it be a DOM node or some other visual thing), if a user clicks inside of it, nothing happens, but if they click outside of it, an event is triggered.**

## Joke

I've been trying to get my husband to read Pride & Prejudice. Whenever I do, he just says, "I’m too good for it, and I have a feeling that it’ll try to lecture me."
