## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you determine if the binary representation of a number was a palindrome. Funky one, eh? Great job Saad, Alfonso, Simon, Bánn, Jonnie, Ashish, Muhammad, Ángel, Amine, Danielle, Ten, Chase, Miguel, Mamush, Joe, Austin, Kyle, Daniel, Andrew, Sreetam, and Josef!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string, calculate the score that it would get in a game of Scrabble.** For extra credit, try verifying if the string is a valid word, or take into account premium squares!

Scoring and example:

```
1 point: E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
2 points: D, G
3 points: B, C, M, P
4 points: F, H, V, W, Y
5 points: K
8 points: J, X
10 points: Q, Z

> scrabbleScore('FIZZBUZZ')
> 49
```
