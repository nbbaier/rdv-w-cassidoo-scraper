## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you format CSV strings! It was a toughie, good work Ten, Ross, David, Paul, Toni, Ross, Paul, and Amine!

This week's question:\
**Given a string `str` and an array of positive integers `widths`, write a function that splits the string into lines, each with the exact number of characters as specified by the corresponding width. Return an array of the substrings.** Use the last width for any remaining characters if the array is shorter than needed.

Example:

```
const str = "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious";
const widths = [5, 9, 4];

> splitByWidths(str, widths);
> ['Super', 'califragi', 'list', 'icex', 'pial', 'idoc', 'ious']
```
