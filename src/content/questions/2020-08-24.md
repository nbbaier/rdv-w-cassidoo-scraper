## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you move all the zeros in an array to the end of the list. We had a TON of responses in probably the most languages I’ve seen for one of the questions here! Great work Gabor, Arkady, Ten, Majo, Sophie, Nwosa, Gustavo, Rakshith, Kaveh, Pirijan, Chera, Sreetam, Maxim, Sameer, Ali, Amy, Rafael, Alan, Dom, Leslie, Stuart, Lucas, Collin, Gabriel, Zac, Jay, Jesse, Brenley, Hyeseong, Thomas, Jagadish, Matthew, Ivana, Anna, Kyle, Angel, and Roman!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string s and a character c, return the number of occurrences of c in s.**

Example:

```
$ numChars('oh heavens', 'h')
$ 2
```
