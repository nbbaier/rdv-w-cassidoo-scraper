## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a restaurant order summary! Order up Amine, Taylor, Dennis, Miguel, Elke, Joey, Sergio, Stephen, Laasya, John, Nico, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Imagine a simplified version of the game Battleship played on a 2D grid. The grid represents the sea, and each cell can either be empty (`.`) or contain a part of a ship (`X`). Ships are placed horizontally or vertically, and there are no adjacent ships. Given a grid, count the number of battleships in it.** Extra credit: can you make a layout generator for the game given these rules?

Example:

```
const ships = [
  ['X', 'X', '.', 'X'],
  ['.', '.', '.', 'X'],
  ['.', '.', '.', 'X'],
  ['.', '.', '.', '.'],
];

numberOfShips(ships)
> 2
```
