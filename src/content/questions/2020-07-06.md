## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return a string (based on another string) with alternating characters between vowels and consonants. I think my example was confusing for some folks because I used y as a consonant. Sorry about that! Anyway, great job James, Ben, Tamás, Ten, and Kyle!

This week’s question:\
**Implement a draggable button that changes the page background color the further away it gets from its original position.**
