## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a honeycomb shape! This was *very* challenging (and based on a real interview question!) so major kudos to Leyan, Amine, Ten, and Neil who got it done!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that produces a generator that produces values in a range.**

Example:

```
let range = fromTo(0,3)

> range()
0
> range()
1
> range()
2
> range()
null
```
