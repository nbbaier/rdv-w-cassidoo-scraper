 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

We had a bunch of responses this week! I had you check if a string is repeated, and we had answers in C, in Java, in Kotlin, and of course, a couple in JavaScript. I hope you had fun with it!

This week's question:\
**Given a 2D array of letters and a word w, return whether or not the word exists in the array. Letters can be matched horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.**

Example:\
w = 'skated';\
q = 'feast';\
grid\[]\[] = {\
"axmy",\
"bgdf",\
"xtet",\
"raks"\
};\
validateBoggle(grid, w);\
\> true\
validateBoggle(grid, q);\
\> false
