Last time, I had you write a tic tac toe game! Andrew submitted this C# solution!

This week's question:\
**Given a a 2D matrix that represents a maze (with 1s as walls and 0s as path). Find a path from one corner to another, backtracking should be allowed. Return an array of steps taken in order.**

## Joke

I went to the library the other day and got a book about revenge. Unfortunately I didn't return it on time, so when I brought it back, the librarian said, "you'll pay for that."
