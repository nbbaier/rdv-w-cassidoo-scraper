## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you calculate ingredient amounts for a recipe! I got as many submissions as I could pre-baby so if I missed ya, sorry about that! That being said, really great job Neha, Leyan, Ten, Miguel, Muhammad, Emeka, Dave, Andrew, Chase, Austin, David, Kyle, Elke, Chris, Kracekumar, Ross, Nick, and John!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it such that consecutive duplicate characters are replaced with the character followed by the count of duplicates. If the count is  `1`, omit it.**

Examples:

```
> compress(["a", "b", "b", "b", "c"])
> ["a", "b", "3", "c"]

> compress(["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"])
> ["a", "2", "b", "2", "c", "3"]
```
