## Interview question of the week

Several of you  you answered the question this past week! My favorite submission I admit though wasn't a solution at all: Tom Bredemeier ended up giving the question to his AP Computer Science students! Totally brightened my day!

Now, onto this week!\
**Given two strings, return if they have a common substring.**

Bonus: Return the common substring(s).\
Bonus x2: Do the original question plus the first bonus in less than O(n^2) time!
