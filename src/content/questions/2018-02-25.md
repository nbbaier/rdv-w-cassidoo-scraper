 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Several of you  you answered the question this past week! My favorite submission I admit though wasn't a solution at all: Tom Bredemeier ended up giving the question to his AP Computer Science students! Totally brightened my day!

Now, onto this week!\
**Given two strings, return if they have a common substring.**

Bonus: Return the common substring(s).\
Bonus x2: Do the original question plus the first bonus in less than O(n^2) time!

## Joke

Two women are drinking in a bar.\
They pull out the sandwiches their husbands had lovingly prepared and get ready to chow down.\
The bartender comes over and says "you can't eat your own food in here."\
So they swapped sandwiches.
