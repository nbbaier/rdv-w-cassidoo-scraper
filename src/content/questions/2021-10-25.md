## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you reorder an array based on certain indexes. Amazing work Leyan, Taylor, Jesper, Augustin, Rafael, Robin, Md, Ten, Daniel, Deepak, Albert, Andrew, Anna, David, Topher, Gabor, Lucia, Alex, Wannes, Daniel, Wesley, Vanessa, Sreetam, Jitendra, Collin, Will, Ariel, Zoe, Les, Jay, Snowie, and Claude!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string `s` where some of the letters can be “wilds” (denoted by an underscore `_`), find the longest palindrome possible from the letters of `s` in order, where the wilds can be any character.**

Example:

```
$ longestPalindrome('abcb_cbcbafg')
$ 'abcbccbcba'

$ longestPalindrome('xyzi_iizy')
$ 'yziiiizy'
```
