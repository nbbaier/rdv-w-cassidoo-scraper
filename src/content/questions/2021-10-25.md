 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given a string `s` where some of the letters can be “wilds” (denoted by an underscore `_`), find the longest palindrome possible from the letters of `s` in order, where the wilds can be any character.**

Example:

```
$ longestPalindrome('abcb_cbcbafg')
$ 'abcbccbcba'

$ longestPalindrome('xyzi_iizy')
$ 'yziiiizy'
```
