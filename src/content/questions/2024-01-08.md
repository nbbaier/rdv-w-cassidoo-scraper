## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you print "Happy new year!" without using the character literals in the string. It was super fun seeing the different answers! Great work Felix, Fran, Altamish, Tawseef, Ten, Muhammad, Miguel, Carlos, Arban, Neil, and Austin!

This week's question:\
**You have an array of letters. Return the number of possible sequences of letters you can make using the letters in the array.** Extra credit: print the sequences!

Example:

```
> letters(['X'])
> 1

> letters(['A', 'A', 'B'])
> 8 // "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA"
```
