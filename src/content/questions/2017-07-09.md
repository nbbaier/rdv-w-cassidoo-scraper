 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

A reader made a weather app for the interview question last week, and it looks awesome! Great work Joey!

**Given an array of integers (let's call it x), calculate the fraction for the number of positive integers, negative integers, and zeros in x. Print each in decimal and fractional notation.**

Note: Try to not use a loop in this one!

## Joke

A pregnant woman is hit by a car. She's sent into a coma for 1 year. She wakes up, no longer pregnant, and yells, "Doctor! Doctor! Where is my baby?!"\
The doctor replies, "Calm down, your babies are fine. You had twins! A girl and a boy. We gave them to your brother to watch while you were in the hospital."\
She says, "My brother? No! That guy is a moron! Why would you do that?"\
"I am sorry ma'am, we had no choice. There was nobody else. He also took the liberty of naming them."\
"Oh no," she says, "What did he name my daughter?"\
"He named her Denise," says the doctor.\
"Oh, well that's not so bad. What did he name my son?"\
"He named him Denephew."
