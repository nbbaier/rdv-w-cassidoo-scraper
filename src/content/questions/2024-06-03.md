## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement a delayed task executor! Awesome work Ten, Amine, Mazen, and John!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array containing only the even numbers, and sorted.**

Example:

```
> onlyEvens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2])
> [2, 2, 4]

> onlyEvens([7, 8, 1, 0, 2, 5])
> [0, 2, 8]

> onlyEvens([11, 13, 15])
> []
```
