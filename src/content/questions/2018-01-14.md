 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

I'll admit, I didn't write a solution to last week's question, so I have nothing for ya. Hope you did it and liked it anyway! I'll do better, I promise. Sometimes life gets in the way. Anyway!

This week's question:\
**Given four positive integers, determine if there is a rectangle such that the lengths of its sides are a, b, c, and d (in any order).**

For example:\
\> makesRectangle(1,2,1,2)\
\> true\
\> makesRectangle(5,6,7,8)\
\> false

Extra credit: Write this function for different shapes, like hexagon or triangle!

## Joke

A book just fell on my head. I’ve only got my shelf to blame.
