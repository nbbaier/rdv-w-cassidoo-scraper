 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you count sequences. Sophie, Dimitris, Leslie, Matthew, George, and Kyle did a great job answering!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of n integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.**

Example:\
\> subLength(13, 35, 1, 5, 40, 86)\
\> 4 // The sequence here would be 1, 5, 40, 86
