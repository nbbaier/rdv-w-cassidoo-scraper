## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement integer division without / or %. We had great answers from Garth in Perl and Crystal (here and here), from Stuart in TypeScript, from Sophie in JavaScript, from Mike in Python, and from Kyle in Ruby! So many different languages! I absolutely loved seeing the variety.

This week's question:\
**Given an array of integers, find the maximum range between two elements in the array.**

Examples:\
\> maxRange(\[2,2,1,3])\
\> 2

\> maxRange (\[0])\
\> 0

\> maxRange (\[4,3,5,7,1,7,7,6])\
\> 6
