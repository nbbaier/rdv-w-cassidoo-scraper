Last week, I had you count perfectly round cookies! You all seem to like cookies. Me too. Great work Mac, Muhammad, Leyan, Neha, Ashish, Amine, John, Ten, Kyle, Kriszti, Mazen, Vincent, and Ricardo!

This week's question:\
**Given a year, return the day of the week for New Year's Day of that year.**

Example:

```
> newYearsDay(2025)
> "Wednesday"

> newYearsDay(2024)
> "Monday"
```
