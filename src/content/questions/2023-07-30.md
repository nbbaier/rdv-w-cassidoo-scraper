## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return stock profits! Such good answers, great job Sreetam, Laurynas, Clifford, Augustin, Miguel, Kelvin, Ollie, Dapo, Dale, Leyan, Chin, Nate, Zoé, Karthick, Daniel, Evan, Neil, Ten, Yosola, Manuel, Christian, Alvin, Arjun, Chase, Jair, and Craig!

This week's question:\
**Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if t is an anagram of s, and `false` otherwise.** Try this in a language you're not comfortable with!

Example:

```
> isAnagram('barbie', 'oppenheimer')
> false

> isAnagram('race', 'care')
> true
```
