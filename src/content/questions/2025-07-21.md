## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you navigate a string with Vim commands! I just can't quit you, Ender, Jen, David, Winnie, Elke, Ten, Ben, Kriszti, Tarang, Andy, Sameer, Wesley, Andrew, and Jeremias!

This week's question:\
**You’re assembling a custom mechanical keyboard. Each required part has a delivery time in days and an assembly time in hours. You can only assemble a part after it arrives, and you can only work on one part at a time. Given an array of parts where each part is `{ name, arrivalDays, assemblyHours }`, return the minimum total hours needed to finish assembling all parts, starting from hour 0.**

Example:

```
minAssemblyTime([
  { name: "keycaps", arrivalDays: 1, assemblyHours: 2 },
  { name: "switches", arrivalDays: 2, assemblyHours: 3 },
  { name: "stabilizers", arrivalDays: 0, assemblyHours: 1 },
  { name: "PCB", arrivalDays: 1, assemblyHours: 4 },
  { name: "case", arrivalDays: 3, assemblyHours: 2 }
])

> 74
```
