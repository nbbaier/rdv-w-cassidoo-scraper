## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you output HTML colors! Y'all did great Amine, John, Paul, Miguel, Stephen, Toni, Ten, George, and Ben!

This week's question:\
**Make a data structure for a deck of cards, and implement a `shuffle()` method, and a `draw(n)` method (where you draw `n` cards).** Calling `draw()` when the deck is empty returns an empty array.

Example usage:

```
const deck = new Deck();
deck.shuffle();
console.log(deck.draw(5)); // Example: ['10♠', 'K♥', '3♣', 'J♦', '7♠']
console.log(deck.draw(5).length); // 5
console.log(deck.draw(2)); // Example: ['5♣', 'A♠']
```
