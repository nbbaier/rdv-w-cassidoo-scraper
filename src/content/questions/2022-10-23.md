## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a function that closes and opens doors. It’s harder than it sounds, I promise. But y’all did a great job with it! Awesome work Zoé, Miguel, Andrew, Les, Rincon, Libreriasjs, David, Muhammad, Thomas, Ten, Amine, Chase, Ryan, Saad, Nick, Giovanni, Tamás, Brian, Sreetam, Laurynas, Jun, Max, Dan, Daniel, Cedric, and Kyle!

This week’s question:\
**Given an integer `n`, print a balanced binary tree with `n` leaf nodes using the characters `/`, , and `\`.**

Examples:

```
> printTree(2)

/\

// or you could output something like:

 /\
/  \

> printTree(3)

 /\
/\ \

// or you could output something like:

  /\
 / /\
/ /  \
```
