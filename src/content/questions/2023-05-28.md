## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you score Scrabble words! Good playing with ya Kyle, Miguel, Charles, Michael, Mazen, Alfonso, Max, Amine, Ángel, Austin, Mamush, Muhammad, Sreetam, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of only one row on a keyboard.** For bonus points, include the option for a user to pick the type of keyboard they are using (ANSI, ISO, etc), and/or give options for how many/which rows are allowed!

Example:

```
> oneRow(['candy', 'fart', 'pop', 'Zelda', 'flag', 'typewriter'])
> ['pop', 'flag', 'typewriter']
```
