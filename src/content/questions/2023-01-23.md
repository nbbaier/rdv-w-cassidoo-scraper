## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a “spin the wheel” game. Y’all had fun with this one, it was a great time looking through submissions! Awesome job Miguel, Dan, Brian, Tamas, Elizabeth, Chinar, Binh, Max, Ángel, Ten, and Daniel!

This week’s question:\
**You are given a list of positive integers which represents some range of integers which has been truncated. Find the missing bits, insert ellipses to show that that part has been truncated, and print it.** If the consecutive values differ by exactly two, then insert the missing value.

Examples:

```
> missingBits([1,2,3,4,20,21,22,23])
> "[1,2,3,4,...,20,21,22,23]"

> missingBits([1,2,3,5,6])
> "[1,2,3,4,5,6]"

> missingBits([1,3,20,27])
> "[1,2,3,...,20,...,27]"
```
