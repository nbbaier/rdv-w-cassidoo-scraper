## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return a list of unused variables! Awesome work Usman, Muhammad, Ricardo, Amine, Vasanth, Ashish, Tawseef, Sujeet, Neil, Ten, and Kriszti!

This week's question:

**Given an array of function logs, where each log consists of a function name, a timestamp, and an event (either `start` or `end`), return the total execution time for each function.** The timestamp is an integer representing milliseconds since the start of the program.

Example:

```
> calculateExecutionTimes([
    { name: "main", time: 0, event: "start" },
    { name: "subTask1", time: 5, event: "start" },
    { name: "subTask1", time: 10, event: "end" },
    { name: "subTask2", time: 15, event: "start" },
    { name: "subTask2", time: 20, event: "end" },
    { name: "main", time: 25, event: "end" }
])
> { main: 25, subTask1: 5, subTask2: 5 }
```
