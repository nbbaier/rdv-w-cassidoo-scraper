## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you determine execution times for functions. I loved these answers!! Awesome work Lucie, Leyan, Tawseef, Ross, Matt, Monica, Ashish, Alison, Jonathan, Muhammad, Fortune, Amine, Prakash, Sujeet, Varenya, David, Mitchell, Ricardo, Chase, Jeremias, Ten, and Kriszti!

This week's question:

**Given a string** `s` containing letters and digits, return the longest substring of `s` where the number of distinct letters is equal to the number of distinct digits. If there are multiple substrings with the same length, return the one that appears first.

Example:

```
> equalLettersAndDigits("abc12345")
> "abc123"

> equalLettersAndDigits("a1")
> "a1"

> equalLettersAndDigits("a12bc34")
> "a12bc3"
```
