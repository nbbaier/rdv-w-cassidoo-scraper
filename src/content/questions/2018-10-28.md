## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you produce a list of numbers that were a product of primes less than a given number n. Aditya wrote up his solution in Java here!

This week's question:\
**Given a set of numbers -50 to 50, find all pairs that add up to a given sum.**

Extra credit: Do this question in less than O(n^2)! Can you do it in O(n)?
