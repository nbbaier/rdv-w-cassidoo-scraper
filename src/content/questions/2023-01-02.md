## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you replace strings of zeros! Great work Chetan, Saad, Chris, Fraol, Muhammad, Leyan, Les, Miguel, KurKestutis, Dan, Robert, Ángel, Humberto, Sean, David, Jun, Kyle, Indrajeet, Ten, David, Chris, Mo, and Bhavik!

This week’s question:\
**Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `n`, return a subarray of `arr` of length `n` where the sum is the largest.** Make sure you maintain the order of the original array, and if `n` is greater than `arr.length`, you can choose what you want to return.

Example:

```
> maxSubarray([-4,2,-5,1,2,3,6,-5,1], 4)
> [1,2,3,6]

> maxSubarray([1,2,0,5], 2)
> [0,5]
```
