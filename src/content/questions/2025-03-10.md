## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you determine prices based on store closing discounts! Ca-ching Ricardo, Jesper, Muhammad, Cat, Amine, Stephen, Sreetam, Tim, Neha, Shreya, Ten, Murtala, Saravana, Saleh, and Abhishek!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes a list of piano keys played in sequence and returns the largest interval (in semitones) between any two consecutive keys.** Assume the lowest note is A0, and the highest is C8.

Examples:

```
> findLargestInterval(['A0', 'C1', 'G1', 'C2'])
> 7

> findLargestInterval(['C4', 'G4', 'C5', 'G3'])
> 17

> findLargestInterval(['E2', 'C3', 'G3', 'C8'])
> 53
```
