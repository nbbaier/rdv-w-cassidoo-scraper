## Interview question of the week

Last time, I had you solve a maze of 1s and 0s! We got some great answers from Saransh, Eva, and Andrew!

This week, we're going to change it up with a non-coding question. Reply to this email with your response! I'm looking forward to reading them (and let me know if you don't want me to share your replies anonymously to next week's letter):\
**Would you continue to contribute to an open-source project if you found out that it was being used for some projects that contradict your personal values?**
