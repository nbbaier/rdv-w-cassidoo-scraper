## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you returns the angles at each point of a star with n points! Great job Josh, Muhammad, Ten, Carine, Ángel, Miguel, and Austin!

This week's question:\
**Given n points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.**

Example:

```
> maxPointsOnLine([[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]])
> 4
```
