## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write your own `split()` function. Great job David, Amine, Claude, Ashish, Chase, Ricardo, John, Kyle, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given a list of ingredients needed for a recipe, represented as strings, and a list of ingredients you have in your pantry, write a function to return the minimum number of additional ingredients you need to buy to make the recipe.** If you want to do some extra credit, add expiration dates to the pantry items, and only account for food that isn't expired.

Example:

```
Input:
recipe = ["eggs", "flour", "sugar", "butter"]
pantry = ["sugar", "butter", "milk"]  

Output:
2
```
