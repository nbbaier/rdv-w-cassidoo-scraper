## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you get the day of the week for New Year's Day of a given year. Some of you kinda cheated with the JavaScript `Date` object but I'll give you a pass, ha! Awesome work Mike, Miguel, Ross, Chris, Muhammad, Damien, Charles, Alix, Kyle, Tim, Amine, Nathan, Neha, Ten (who has been writing answers for 5 YEARS STRAIGHT now!), Ashish, Danny, Andrew, Mazen, Vincent, John, Jeremias, Alison, Kriszti, and Ricardo (who added a neat twist)!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that generates all possible permutations of a given string.** Careful, the results could get long!

Example:

```
> permute('abc')
> ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on Bluesky, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Mastodon)
