## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a connected line of slashes. There were some really creative answers!! Great job Will, Gabor, Allen, Saad, Matt, Miguel, Leyan, Binh, Fraol, Krem, Robin, Andy, Daniel, Ten, Abdelrahmen, Muhammad, Raymond, Thomas, Max, Amine, and Zoé!

This week’s question:\
**Given an 8x8 chess board, a piece, and a move coordinate, determine if the given move is a valid chess move.** Capital letters represent white pieces, lowercase letters represent black pieces, where `P` is a white pawn, `n` is a black knight, `K` is a white king, and so on. A `~` represents a blank square, and you can use this tool if you need a helpful visual! You can choose to do absolute coordinates or relative ones, and decide how you want to differentiate between duplicate pieces.

Example:

```
let board =
    [\`~~~~~~~~
      ~~kb~~~~
      ~~K~~~~~
      ~~~~~~~~
      ~~~~~~~~
      ~~~~~~~~
      ~~~~~~~~
      ~~~R~~~~\`]

> isValidMove(board, 'R', [0,0])
> false // A rook can only move horizontally and vertically

> isValidMove(board, 'k', [0,1])
> true // A king can move one square at a time in any direction

> isValidMove(board, 'Q', [5,7])
> false // The queen is not on the board
```
