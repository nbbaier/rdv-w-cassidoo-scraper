 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

**You are in a full movie theater, and need to use the bathroom. Write a function that will determine the minimum number of people you will bother by getting up to go to the bathroom (assuming the people in your row and everyone behind your row as you stand up and walk will be annoyed with you), given your seat row and column, and the number of rows and columns in the theater.**

For example, when numCols = 16, numRows = 11, myCol = 5 and myRow = 3:

```
> seatsInTheater(numCols, numRows, myCol, myRow)
> 45
```

## Joke

I keep getting hit by the same bike, at the same time and place, day after day… it’s a vicious cycle.

Have a good week friends. Be safe, make good choices, and stretch your wrists after typing.
