 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question is brought to you by Sourcegraph!\
**Given a file named `merry-christmas.txt` that has a single integer x in it, write a script to generate a Christmas tree with asterisks (\*) and output it as `happy-holidays.txt`.** The tree should have a height of x, and if `merry-christmas.txt` is empty, the height should be 25 asterisks tall.

Example (you can be flexible with your output, but this might be helpful for you as a starting point):

```
// merry-christmas.txt
3

// happy-holidays.txt
  *
 ***
*****
```
