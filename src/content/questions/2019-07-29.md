## Interview question of the week

Last time, I asked you to write a function that returned all possible palindromes that could be formed of a given string! Stuart came up with a great answer in TypeScript:)

This week's question:\
**Given two arrays of arrival and departure times of trains that go to a particular railway station, find the minimum number of platforms required at the station so that no train has to wait.**

Example:\
let arrivals = \[9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00]\
let departures = \[9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00]

minTracks(arrivals, departures)\
\> 3 // There are at most three trains present at a time, between 11:00 to 11:20
