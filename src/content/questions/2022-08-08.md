## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the number of one digits given a number. This one was so interesting and subtly challenging, I loved seeing all of the solutions! Hristiyan wrote a really cool blog post here about how to solve it. And for the solvers, great work Sreetam, Aodhan, Will, Ryan, Eric, Muhammad, Kelvin, Garth, Saad, Ten, June, Vanessa, Chuan, Sophie, Zamar, Jagadish, Ciarán, Will, Theodore, Philip, Lucien, Chase, Gülşah, Leyan, Andrew, Mo, Ryan, Clov, Sofi, Don, Samu, Karla, Kyle, and Lucia!

This week’s question:\
**Given a list, swap every two adjacent nodes.** Something to think about: How would your code change if this were a linked list, versus an array?

Example:

```
> swapPairs([1,2,3,4])
> [2,1,4,3]

> swapPairs([])
> []
```
