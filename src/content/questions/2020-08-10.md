## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you sort strings based in distinct characters in a word. Nice work Gonzalo, Tamás, Melody, Julian, Eleanor, Stuart, Alberto, Stephen, Gabor, Ten, Collin, Dylan, Antonio, Étienne, and Kyle!

This week’s question:\
**There are x lions, y tigers, z leopards, and w panthers. Find the number of ways to place them on a line such that no two same animals are adjacent to each other (assume w, x, y, and z are <= 50).**
