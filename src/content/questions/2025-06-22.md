## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you put monarchs in order. It was a funky one! A royally good job to Elke, Chris, David, Muhammad, Ten, Pedro, Tarang, Raymond, Winnie, Colin, Patrycja, and Neha!

This week's question:\
**You’re given an array of siren objects, each with a start and end time in seconds, representing when the siren is active. Write a function to return the minimum number of sirens you need to remove so that no two sirens overlap.**

Example:

```
removeSirens([
  { start: 1, end: 5 },
  { start: 3, end: 7 },
  { start: 6, end: 8 },
  { start: 8, end: 10 }
]);
> 1

removeSirens([
  { start: 0, end: 3 },
  { start: 2, end: 4 },
  { start: 5, end: 7 },
  { start: 6, end: 8 },
  { start: 8, end: 10 }
])
> 2
```
