## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you work with calories and prices, and oof, it was harder than it looked! Amazing job Ten, Anirban, Neil, and Muhammad!

This week's question:\
**There is a sorted integer array that has been rotated an unknown number of times. Given that rotated array, return how many times it has been rotated.** It may contain duplicate numbers!

Example:

```
> rotatedNum([4, 0, 1, 2, 3])
> 1

> rotatedNum([7, 9, 20])
> 0

> rotatedNum([7, 7, 314, 1337, 7])
> 4
```
