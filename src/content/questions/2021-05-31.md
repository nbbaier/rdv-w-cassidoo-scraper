## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a Connect Four game! There were some really fun entries this time around, awesome job Ashwin, Ten, Tobias, Jesper, Dani, Leyan, Les, Face the Wolf, Ricardo, and Jay!

This week’s question:\
**Given a list, return a list of all its prefixes in ascending order of their length.** You’re essentially implementing the inits function in Haskell!

Example:

```
$ inits([4, 3, 2, 1])
$ [[], [4], [4,3], [4,3,2], [4,3,2,1]]

$ inits([144])
$ [[], [144]]
```
