## Interview question of the week

**Write a program that schedules projects. Function scheduler() takes in 2 parameters:**

* **tasks which is an array of pairs that looks like \[taskName, numHours], where taskName is the name of the task and numHours is the number of hours the task takes.**
* **workDayLength is an integer that is the number of hours you work in a day.**
  **and scheduler returns the minimum number of days that it will take to finish the tasks, and prints the order in which they should be completed.**

Example input:

```
scheduler([['go fishing', 2], ['eat a ton of cake', 3], ['take a nap', 4], ['work', 1]], 4)
```
