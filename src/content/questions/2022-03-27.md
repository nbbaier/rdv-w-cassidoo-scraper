 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given a string that represents items as asterisks (`*`) and compartment walls as pipes (`|`), a start index, and an end index, return the number of items in a closed compartment.**

Example:

```
let str = '|**|*|*'

> containedItems(str, 0, 5)
> 2

> containedItems(str, 0, 6)
> 3

> containedItems(str, 1, 7)
> 1
```

Extra credit: What if you had multiple pairs of start and end indices? You can do it in O(n) time!
