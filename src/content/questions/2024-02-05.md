## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a calculator for days between two dates. There were some creative solutions! Great work Sagnik, Nathael, David, Vesa, Miguel, Jan-Magnus, Thomas, Neil, Arban, Muhammad, Austin, Amine, Aodhan, Ten, and Ryan!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that makes an ASCII "honeycomb" shape of a given size.**

Example:

```

      __
   __/  \__
  /  \__/  \
  \__/  \__/
  /  \__/  \
  \__/  \__/
     \__/

> honeycomb(4)
          ____
         /    \
    ____/      \____
   /    \      /    \
