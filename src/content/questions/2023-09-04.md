## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you generate a "count and say" string. This had a lot of directions it could go in, and y'all didn't disappoint! Great job Saad, Miguel, Usman, Ben, Ten, Stephen, Leo, Karthic, Neil, Rob, Jonnie, Sreetam, Bhavesh, Andrew, and Clifford!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of integers and a number `k` (where `k` is guaranteed to be less than the array's length), return a subarray of length `k` with the minimum possible sum.** Maintain the order of the original array!

Example:

```
> minSubs([1,3,20,4,8,9,11], 3)
> [4,8,9]

> minSubs([4,4,4,4,8], 2)
> [4,4]
```
