## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find ways to score in American football! Many Europeans shouted at me and I simply saluted the eagle flying past my window screeching "freedom." Anyway, awesome work Claude, Kyle, Ashish, Max, Ten, Alison, Amine, Ricardo, Varenya, and Muhammad!

This week's question:\
**You're designing a smart laundry sorting system. You have a list of clothing items, each with a color and a fabric type. Sort these items into the minimum number of loads `n` and return `n`, where items of the same color can be washed together, and some different fabric types cannot be mixed together.** "Normal" fabric types can be mixed with "heavy", but "delicate" cannot be mixed with anything.

Example:

```
let load1 = [
    ["red", "normal"],
    ["blue", "normal"],
    ["red", "delicate"],
    ["blue", "heavy"]
]

let load2 = [
    ["white", "normal"],
    ["white", "delicate"],
    ["white", "normal"],
    ["white", "heavy"]
]

> minLaundryLoads(load1)
> 3 // one delicate red, one normal red, and one with the blues

> minLaundryLoads(load2)
> 2 // one delicate white, one with everything else
```
