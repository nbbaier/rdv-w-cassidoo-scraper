## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find specific substrings. There were some tricky answers! Great job Gu, Jeroen, Amine, John, The Math Jester, Mazen, Saad, Nathael, Ryan, Kyle, Ten, and Pozorvlak!

This week's question:\
**Given a direction and a number, write a function that outputs an arrow of asterisks with the height of that number!** See the pattern below.

Example:

```
$ printArrow('right', 3)
*
 *
  *
 *
*

$ printArrow('left', 5)
    *
   *
  *
 *
*
 *
  *
   *
    *

$ printArrow('up', 2)
  *
 * *
```
