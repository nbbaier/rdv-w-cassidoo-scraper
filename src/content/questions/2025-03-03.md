## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you tune musical notes! Do re mi fa so-lid work David, Jorge, Austin, Ten, Jawara, Neha, Shreya, Vyaas, Ricardo, and Saleh!

This week's question:\
**A store is going out of business and will reduce the price of all products by 10% every week leading up to the closing date. Given the `closingDate`, `visitDate`, and the `originalPrice` of a product, write a function that returns the price of the product on the `visitDate`.** You can assume that `originalPrice` is a positive number.

Example:

```
calculatePrice('2025-04-01', '2025-03-03', 100); // 4 weeks of discounts
> 65.61
calculatePrice('2025-04-01', '2025-03-15', 50);  // 2 weeks of discounts
> 40.5
calculatePrice('2025-04-01', '2025-04-15', 75);  // No discount (visit after closing)
> 75
```
