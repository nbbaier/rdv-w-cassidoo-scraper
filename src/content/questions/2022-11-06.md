## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you print ASCII printable characters! Great job Will, Zoé, Ryan, Andy, Tamás, Chase, Max, Amine, Muhammad, Saad, Josh, Brian, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given a positive integer `n`, return all of its anti-divisors.** Anti-divisors are numbers that do not divide a number by the largest possible margin (1 is not an anti-divisor of any number). More information here!

Example:

```
> antidivisor(1)
> []

> antidivisor(3)
> [2]

> antidivisor(5)
> [2,3]

> antidivisor(10)
> [3,4,7]

> antidivisor(234)
> [4,7,12,36,52,67,156]
```
