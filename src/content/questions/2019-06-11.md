## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the maximum range between two elements in an integer array! Here are all of the great responses: bang bing bong bleh blip bloop (...sometimes I'm not feeling creative when I'm typing these things out, heh)

This week's question:\
**Write a converter for HEX codes to RGB!**

Bonus, make a pretty UI for it too <3
