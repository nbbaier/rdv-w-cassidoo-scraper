## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return the previous Fibonacci number. Great job Sophie, Dan, Claude, Elizabeth, Andros, Divyansh, Ben, Will, Les, Genaro, Charles, Ten, Neeraj, Joel, Leyan, Andrew, Stephen, Amine, Michael, Diego, Rafael, Andrew, Julian, Andrew, Hristiyan, Don, and Nicole!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string `str` and a set of words `dict`, find the longest word in `dict` that is a subsequence of `str`.**

Example:

```
let str = "abppplee"
let dict = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"}

$ longestWord(str, dict)
$ 'apple'
// "able" and "ale" also work, but are shorter than "apple"
// "bale" has all the right letters, but not in the right order
```
