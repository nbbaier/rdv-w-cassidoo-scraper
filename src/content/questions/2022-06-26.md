 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given a string `str` and a set of words `dict`, find the longest word in `dict` that is a subsequence of `str`.**

Example:

```
let str = "abppplee"
let dict = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"}

$ longestWord(str, dict)
$ 'apple'
// "able" and "ale" also work, but are shorter than "apple"
// "bale" has all the right letters, but not in the right order
```
