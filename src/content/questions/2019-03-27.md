## Interview question of the week

We had a ton of responses this week! Kyle, Luis, Dimitris, Stuart, Nathan, Will, Daniel, Mike, and  Ethan all did a great job finding numbers that were perfect squares and cubes.

This week's question:\
**Given an integer N, find the number of trailing zeroes in the base 16 representation of the factorial of N.**

trailing(6)\
\> 1 // 6! = 720 (base 10) = 2D0 (base 16)
