## Interview question of the week

Last time, I had you write a function addg that adds from many invocations, until it sees an empty invocation.\
Here's my solution!

```
function addg(a) {
  if(a === undefined) return a;
    return function g(b) {
      if(b !== undefined) {
        return addg(a+b);
      }
      return a;
    };
  }
```

This week's question:

**Write a program that takes in a text file of sentences, and returns a 2D array where the larger array is broken up by sentences, and the inner arrays are broken up by words.**

For example, if the text file contents are:\
I find fire to be dangerous and wild. It destroys all things in its wake. It can't be tamed. Like me.

The output would be:

```
[["I", "find", "fire", "to", "be", "dangerous", "and", "wild.",],
  ["It", "destroys", "all", "things", "in", "its", "wake."],
  ["It", "can't", "be", "tamed."],
  ["Like", "me."]]
```
