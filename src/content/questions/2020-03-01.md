## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make an event emitter! Good work Abdullah, Ten, Gustavo, Tamás, Matt, Stefan, Jesse, Louis, and Dimitris!

This week’s question:\
**Write a function that when given a positive integer n and a digit d (which is not 0), outputs a way to represent n using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, division, concatenation, parenthesis and the digit d.**

Example:

```
n =  6, d = 1  =>  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
n = 10, d = 1  =>  1 | 1 - 1
n = 12, d = 1  =>  1 | (1 + 1)
n = 64, d = 2  =>  2 ^ (2 + 2 + 2)
n =  1, d = 9  =>  9 / 9
```

(In this example, | represents concatenation)
