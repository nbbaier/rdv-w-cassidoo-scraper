## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you generate SVG circles! It was fun seeing messages from some of you having not used SVGs before. Great job Mike, Kostas, Austin, Ten, Alison, John, Josh, Muhammad, and Ricardo!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes in an RSS feed URL, and returns the title of and link to the the original feed source.** You can get other things too, if you'd like!

Example:

```
getRSS('https://cassidoo.co/rss.xml')
"Cassidy Williams, https://cassidoo.co/"

getRSS("https://feed.syntax.fm/")
"Syntax - Tasty Web Development Treats, https://syntax.fm"
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on LinkedIn, Twitter, Mastodon, or Bluesky)
