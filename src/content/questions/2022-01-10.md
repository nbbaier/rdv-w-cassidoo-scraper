## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return possible paths between points. I loved the variety of answers! Awesome job Yash, Ben, Pedro, Rafael, Don, Leyan, Jay, Laryssa, Adam, Daniel, Ten, and Ivana!

This week’s question is sponsored by Sourcegraph!\
**Given a string s, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase. Return a list of all possible permutations you could create from s.**

Example:

```
$ capPermutations("ab2")
$ ["ab2","aB2","Ab2","AB2"]

$ capPermutations("35p")
$ ["35p","35P"]
```
