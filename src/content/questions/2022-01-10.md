 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question is sponsored by Sourcegraph!\
**Given a string s, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase. Return a list of all possible permutations you could create from s.**

Example:

```
$ capPermutations("ab2")
$ ["ab2","aB2","Ab2","AB2"]

$ capPermutations("35p")
$ ["35p","35P"]
```
