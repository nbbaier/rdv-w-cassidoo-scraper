## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the shortest paths in a 2D matrix. Great job Karey, Will, Amine, Mo, Leyan, Ten, Ben, Les, Kelvin, and Giovanni!

This week’s question:\
**Write a function that determines if all the characters in a given string are unique.** Can you do this without making any new variables? You choose if you want to include capitalization in your consideration for this one, as a fun challenge.

Example:

```
> allUnique('Cassidy')
> false

> allUnique('cat & dog')
> false

> allUnique('cat+dog')
> true
```
