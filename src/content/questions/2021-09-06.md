## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find the longest common prefix in an array of strings. Awesome job Gabor, Will, Shannon, Akhil, Topher, Taylor, Andrew, Les, Thomas, Mike, Alex, Harsh, Sreetam, Chris, Jesper, Leyan, Ten, Ann, Claude, Bashu, Ben, Deepak, David, Daniel, Dhaval, Dan, Daniel, Micah, and Chris!

This week’s question:\
**Given two non-negative integers `n1` and `n2` represented as strings, return the product of `n1` and `n2`, also represented as a string.** Twist: You can’t use any built-in language integer libraries nor convert the inputs to integers directly.

Example:

```
$ stringProduct("123", "456")
$ "56088"
```
