## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you add operators to make an expression, and it was a tough one! Awesome job Ten, Miguel, Neil, Henri, Christian, Frances, and Karthick!

This week's question:\
**Convert a number in English words to an integer.** You can assume the number will never go beyond the millions, and there will be no punctuation.

Example:

```
> parseNumber("Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five")
> 12345

> parseNumber("One Hundred Twenty Three")
> 123
```
