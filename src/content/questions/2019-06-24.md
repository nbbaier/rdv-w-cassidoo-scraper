## Interview question of the week

Last time, I had you write a HEX to RGB converter! We had some great submissions, both from people who made UIs and who didn't.\
\- Dimitris made this one\
\- Garth deployed this one\
\- Mike made a repo of this one\
\- Stuart made this one\
\- Kyle penned this one\
\- Ian posted this one\
Really great job everyone, this one was really fun to see people try out!!

This week's question is a non-coding question:\
**Explain the difference between a high-level and a low-level programming language. How would you explain it to a non-programmer?**
