 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

We had tons of responses to the question last week about validating a triangle! Props to Sophie, Thomas, Stuart, Marcela, Ethan (twice!), Kyle, Eva, and  Bukola!

This week's question:\
**Given strings n and m, find the minimum number of times n has to be repeated such that m is a substring of it (and if it's not possible, return -1).**

Example:\
\> repeatedSubstring('abcd', ' cdabcdab')\
\> 3 // When you repeat n 3 times, it becomes 'abcdabcdabcd', and m isn't a substring of n when it's repeated less than 3 times

\> repeatedSubstring('ab', ' cab')\
\> -1
