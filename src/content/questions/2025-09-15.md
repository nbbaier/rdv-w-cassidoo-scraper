## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you sum up neighboring elements in an array! Awesome work Sreetam, Jonathan, Mike, Collin, Miguel, David, Elke, Muhammad, Victor, Gavin, Paul, Amine, Sergio, Ten, Leyan, and Kaartic!

This week's question:\
**You are given an array of arrays, where each inner array represents the runs scored by each team in an inning of a baseball game: `[[home1, away1], [home2, away2], ...]`. Write a function that returns an object with the total runs for each team, which innings each team led, and who won the game.**

Example:

```
const innings = [[1, 0], [2, 2], [0, 3], [4, 1]];

> analyzeBaseballGame(innings) 
> {
    homeTotal: 7,
    awayTotal: 6,
    homeLedInnings: [1, 2, 4],
    awayLedInnings: [3],
    winner: "home"
  }
```
