## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement function that generated well-formed parenthesis. Great work Sameer, Jake, Alex, Ten, Lenz, Samy, Sophie, Dimitris, Tigran, Martin, Vivek, Alexandre, Roman, Dutheil, Jakob, eliykat, and Collin!

This week’s question:\
**Given n points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.**

Example:

```
$ maxPointsOnLine([[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]])
$ 4
```
