 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question courtesy of Louis:\
**Given that an “even word” is a word in which each character appears an even number of times, write a function that takes in a string and returns the minimum number of letters to be removed to make that string an even word.**

Example:

```
evenWord('aaaa')
> 0
```

evenWord(‘potato’)

> 2
