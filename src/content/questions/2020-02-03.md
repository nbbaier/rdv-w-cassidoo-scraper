## Interview question of the week

Last week I gave you a tricky one, to implement a “hello world” program without repeating any characters in your program except whitespace. If you want to see some non-newsletter answers, this question was inspired by this one on the CodeGolf Stack Exchange. Some of you nailed it, some of you didn’t get it, some were close, and I particularly enjoyed the couple of you who just used the whitespace programming language to solve it! Anyway, overall great job Sophie, Chad, Julio, Ten, Bisuga, Oswaldo, Dimitris, Rubén, and Yuval!

This week’s question courtesy of Louis:\
**Given that an “even word” is a word in which each character appears an even number of times, write a function that takes in a string and returns the minimum number of letters to be removed to make that string an even word.**

Example:

```
evenWord('aaaa')
> 0
```

evenWord(‘potato’)

> 2
