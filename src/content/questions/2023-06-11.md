## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out how many pies to order based on what people want. And y'all want pie! Great job Priti, Mitchell, Ann, Miguel, Monica, Josh, Muhammad, Fraol, Ten, Jonnie, Vishwa, Ángel, Craig, Churchill, Daniel, Sreetam, Heather, Amine, and Craig!

This week's question:\
**Given an array `arr` and integers `n` and `m`, remove `n` elements from the front of the array, and `m` elements from the back.** Assume that `n + m <= arr.length`.

Example:

```
> trimArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2, 1)
> [3, 4, 5]

> trimArray([6, 2, 4, 3, 7, 1, 3], 5, 0)
> [1, 3]

> trimArray([1, 7], 0, 0)
> [1, 7]
```
