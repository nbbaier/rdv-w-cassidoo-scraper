## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you score a cribbage hand! This one was sneakily challenging. Good job pushing through Jesper, Ten, A.D., Neha, and Levi!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that finds the longest streak of consecutive `true` values in a boolean array that meets or exceeds a given streak goal.** Return 0 if no such streak exists.

Examples:

```
findLongestStreak([true, true, false, true, true, true], 3)
3

findLongestStreak([true, true, true, false, true], 4)
0

findLongestStreak([true, true, true, true], 2)
4
```
