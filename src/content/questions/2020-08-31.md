Last week, I had you count characters in a string. Great work Joel, Waylon, Benjamin, Jay, Ashir, Rafael, Sreetam, Ganz, Lihbr, Rizwan, Kamal, Dimitrij, Kev, Ten, Gabor, Jonsey, Roman, Gustavo, Yash, Matheus, Monica, Tianon, Leslie, Jakob, Will, Kosal, Gonza, Yuetsu, Raffifu, Tom, Jacob, and Matthew!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of numbers that represent stock prices (where each number is the price for a certain day), find 2 days when you should buy and sell your stock for the highest profit.**

Example:

```
$ stockBuySell([110, 180, 260, 40, 310, 535, 695])
$ "buy on day 4, sell on day 7"
```
