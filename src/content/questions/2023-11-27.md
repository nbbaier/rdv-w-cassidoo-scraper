## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return certain numbers between two integers. Awesome work Miguel, Saad, Ten, Fernando, Josh, Steve, Anirban, Neil, Fraol, Austin, Karthick, and Chase!

This week's question:\
**Given two arrays `calories` and `prices`, where `calories[i]` and `prices[i]` represent the calorie content and price of the `i` th food item, and a daily calorie goal, find the minimum cost to achieve or exceed the daily calorie goal. If it's impossible to meet the goal, return -1.**

Example:

```
let calories = [200, 400, 600, 800]
let prices = [50, 60, 80, 100]
let dailyGoal = 1200

> minCostForCalories(calories, prices, dailyGoal)
> 160 // the 2nd and 4th items add up to 1200 calories for the minimum cost
```
