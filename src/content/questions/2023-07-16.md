## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you justify text. I appreciated the funny commentary as y'all realized it was a tricky one! Amazing work Saad, Leyan, Kelvin, Miguel, Manuel, Ten, Clifford, and Sreetam!

This week's question:\
**Given a string, separate it into groups of non-space equal characters, sorted.**

Example:

```
> explodeString('Ahh, abracadabra!')
> ['!',',','A','aaaaa','bb','c','d','hh','rr']

> explodeString('\o/\o/')
> ['//','\\','oo']
```
