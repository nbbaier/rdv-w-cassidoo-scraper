## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you plan a chess knight's move! Checkmate Taylor, David, Ten, Jihchi, Micah, Amine, Gavin, Kaartic, and Toni!

This week's question:\
**You are given two sorted arrays, `a` and `b`, where `a` has a large enough size buffer at the end to hold `b` (which can be spaces, zeroes, or nulls). Write a function to merge `b` into `a` in sorted order.**

Example:

```
let a = [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0];
let b = [2, 4, 6];

> merge(a, b)
> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
