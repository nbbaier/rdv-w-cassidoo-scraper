## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a pomodoro timer! Awesome work Sam, Amine, Alexandra, Nathael, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given an integer array `arr`, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in `arr` 's sorted form.** Return 0 if there's 0 or 1 elements.

Example:

```
> maxGap([3,6,9,1,2])
> 3
```
