 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you the last non-repeating character in a given string. We got great submissions, in many languages! Every word in that sentence is a different one.:)

This week's question:\
**Implement integer division without using / or %.**

***

## Cool things from around the internet

Ergodox with SA Vilebloom\
There Is Too Much Stuff\
How to escape when you're handcuffed to a rope

***

## Joke

I WRITE MY JOKES IN CAPITALS\
THIS ONE WAS WRITTEN IN LONDON

(you should know that I waited for weeks until my trip to actually write this one down so it would be true)
