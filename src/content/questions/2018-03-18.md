## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you take in the coordinates of two rectangles and determine the area of their intersection!\
I got some fun answers from Eva and Thomas this time around. Keep 'em coming!

This week's question:\
**Write a program for a laundromat. Include a data structure that represents each washing machine, and properties to tell whether or not it's in use, how much it costs, and how long a wash will take.**

Bonus points: make a user interface on top of the program for someone to pick a machine and use it!
