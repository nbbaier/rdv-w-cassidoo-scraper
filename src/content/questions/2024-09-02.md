## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find substrings! There was actually a typo in the example and I fixed it in the archive. Some of y'all have eagle eyes and the typo didn't faze you, awesome job Tawseef, Ricardo, Adrianna, Muhammad, John, Cheyenne, and Ten!

This week's question:

**You are given an array of strings representing a collection of shoes. Each shoe is labeled with its type ("L" for left or "R" for right) and its size. Determine the maximum number of matching pairs of shoes that can be formed.**

Example:

```
> maxPairs(["L-10", "R-10", "L-11", "R-10", "L-10", "R-11"])
> 3

> maxPairs(["L-10", "L-11", "L-12", "L-13"])
> 0

> maxPairs(["L-8", "L-8", "L-8", "R-8"])
> 1
```
