## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make some arrows out of asterisks based on user input! Great work Gabor, Griffin, Nathan, Refi.64, Face the Wolf, Dani, Rafael, Melo, Patrick, Binh, David, ValeYellow46, Leyan, Dhanush, Jesper, Neeraj, Dimitris, Tamás, Claude, Taylor, Daniel, Andrew, Mike, Achraf, Ashleigh, Mark, Tianon, Sreetam, Kushagra, Vitor, Augustin, Shreya, Jay, Bashu, Craig, Les, Alex, and Ten!

This week’s question is a variation of last week’s:\
**Write a function that draws an ASCII art cube of given height x.**

Example:

```
$ drawCube(2)
  +----+
 /    /|
+----+ |
|    | +
|    |/
+----+

$ drawCube(4)

   +--------+
  /        /|
 /        / |
+--------+  |
|        |  |
|        |  +
|        | /
|        |/
+--------+
```
