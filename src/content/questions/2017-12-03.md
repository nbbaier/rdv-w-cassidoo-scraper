## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find a unique number in an unsorted array of duplicate numbers. There's a ton of different solutions to this problem! Some people were able to solve it in one line, and one guy wrote a fun blog post on his approach. My favorite answer (purely because it's really interesting) is one that I saw on Stack Overflow, where you XOR all of the elements in the list, and the only element that isn't 0 as a result is the answer.

This week's problem:\
**Given an array of numbers, return a list of all pairs that add up to zero.**
