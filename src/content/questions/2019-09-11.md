 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I asked you a sorting question given a custom alphabet! Ilya and Yuan, Mustafa, Marcela, joliebulle, Stuart, Micah, and Daniel had great answers!

This week's question:\
**Write a function where given an array of integers (where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element), return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element).**

Example:\
miniJump(\[1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9])\
\> 3 // 1-> 3 -> 8 ->9, so here the first element is 1, so can only go to 3. Second element is 3, so can make at most 3 steps (to 5 or 8 or 9). If you encounter a 0 in the array, just return -1.
