## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return the sum of positive squares! Y'all had some OPTIMIZED and clever solutions! Awesome job Mike, Andy, Muhammad, Usman, Ashish, Amine, Joe, Mitchell, Josh, Sathyesh, Chase, Sean, Ricardo, Kriszti, Brenda, Caleb, John, Neil, Arban, Ten, Alison, and Clov!

This week's question:

**Given an array of logs and variable assignments, return a list of all unused variables.**

Examples:

```
> findUnused(["a = 1", "b = a", "c = 2", "log(b)"]);
> ["c"]

> findUnused(["a = 1", "b = a", "c = 2", "log(c)"]);
> ["a", "b"]
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on LinkedIn, Twitter, Mastodon, or Bluesky)

This question is brought to you by ⚡ SquiggleConf: a conference for excellent web dev tooling! Unused variable detection is one of the many awesome things web dev tooling can do for you.
