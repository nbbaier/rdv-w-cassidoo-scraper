 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given three numbers, return their product. But, if one of the numbers is the same as another, it does not count: If two numbers are similar, return the lonely number. If all numbers are same, return 1.**

Example:

```
$ lonelyNumber(1,2,3)
$ 6

$ lonelyNumber(6,6,4)
$ 4

$ lonelyNumber(7,7,7)
$ 1
```
