## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement the Haskell `inits` function! Awesome work Sophie, Dhanush, Leyan, Vanessa, Vishwa, Les, Ashleigh, Maaz, Neeraj, Jean-François, Jesper, Face the Wolf, Sreetam, Emmanuel, Lakshay, Lucie, Rafael, Ricardo, Dominic, Kushagra, Thomas, Ivana, Ashwin, Shriram, Mark, Kofi, Ten, and Shreya!

This week's question:\
**Given three numbers, return their product. But, if one of the numbers is the same as another, it does not count: If two numbers are similar, return the lonely number. If all numbers are same, return 1.**

Example:

```
$ lonelyNumber(1,2,3)
$ 6

$ lonelyNumber(6,6,4)
$ 4

$ lonelyNumber(7,7,7)
$ 1
```
