## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you get combinations of letters from numbers on a phone. Awesome work Ben, Claude, Gabor, Will, Rafael, Adam, Robin, Don, Rizwan, Topher, Zhenghao, Leyan, Ten (who has now done 100 solutions in a row!!!), William, Les, Zoe, Dan, Brian, Md, Micah, Brandon, and Arun!

This week's question:\
**You have to order wrapping paper for presents. Given the length, width, and height of the boxes you need to wrap, return the number of square feet (or whatever units you want) of wrapping paper you need to order.** Extra credit: allow for other shapes of presents and their dimensions!

Example:

```
$ wrap(2, 3, 4)
$ 52 square feet
```
