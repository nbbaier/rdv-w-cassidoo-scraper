## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you repeat integers in an array! Good good job job Tim, Ethan, Ross, Danny, Micah, Miguel, Ten, David, Stephen, Marco, Jihchi, Vincent, Kriszti, Amine, Sergio, Ken, Jordan, Valentin, Chriztian, Gavin, Clifford, Kaartic, and Toni!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of meal prep tasks for Thanksgiving, where each task is represented as `[taskName, startTime, endTime]`, return the maximum number of non-overlapping tasks you can complete, along with the names of the chosen tasks in the order they were selected.** Task times are inclusive of start but exclusive of end.

Example:

```
const tasks = [
  ["Make Gravy", 10, 11],
  ["Mash Potatoes", 11, 12],
  ["Bake Rolls", 11, 13],
  ["Prep Salad", 12, 13]
];

maxMealPrepTasks(tasks)
> {
    count: 3,
    chosen: ["Make Gravy", "Mash Potatoes", "Prep Salad"]
  }
```
