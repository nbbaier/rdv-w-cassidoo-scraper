## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you merge two arrays! Awesome job Nate, Gavin, Micah, Vincent, Ross, David, Miguel, Ten, Kaartic, Toni, and Juliano,!

This week's question:\
**Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns an array containing all integers from 1 to `n`, where each integer `i` appears exactly `i` times in the result. For example, 3 should appear 3 times, 5 should appear 5 times, and so on.** The order of the integers in the output array does not matter.

Example:

```
> repeatedIntegers(4)
> [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```
