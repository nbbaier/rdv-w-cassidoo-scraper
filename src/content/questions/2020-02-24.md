## Interview question of the week

Sean Ten Stefan Dimitris Oswaldo Galdin Jesse

**Write an event emitter that has three methods: on, emit, and removeListener.\
The \`on\` function takes in an event name and a callback function, the \`emit\` function takes in an event name and data (which will be passed to the associated callback), and \`removeListener\` takes in an event name and a callback to remove from that event.**
