## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find a firework show's grand finale! Boom boom Ender, Elke, Winnie, Ten, Sameer, Amine, Parthipan, Varenya, Paul (who made a fun digital fireworks show!), Patrycja, and Kriszti!

This week's question:\
**Given a multi-line string and a sequence of Vim navigation commands (`h` for left, `j` for down, `k` for up, and `l` for right), and starting at the top-left character, write a function that processes the commands and returns the character under the cursor.** If the cursor tries to move out of bounds, keep it at the last valid position.

Example:

```
const string = \`Hello, world!
how are ya?\`; // or "Hello, world!\nhow are ya?"
const commands = 'jlhll';

getCharAfterVimCommands(string, commands)
> 'w'
```
