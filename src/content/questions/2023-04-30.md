## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make an integer based on an array, divisible by a given number. It was a funky one and y'all did great, nice job Ángel, Ten, Miguel, Pozorvlak, Amine, Carlo, and Josef!

This week's question:\
**Given a non-empty array containing only non-negative integers, return the list with trailing and leading zeroes removed.**

Example:

```
> removeZeroes([0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0])
> [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]

> removeZeroes([0, 0, 0])
> []

> removeZeroes([8])
> [8]
```
