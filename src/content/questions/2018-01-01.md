 ## Interview question of the week

Last time, I had you make a Christmas tree function!

My favorite solution was from @StewartUlm, and you can see it here.

This week’s question:\
**Given a number n, find whether all digits of n divide it.**

For example:

```
digitsDivide(128)
> true
digitsDivide(130)
> false
digitsDivide(4)
> true
```
