## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you truncate words! There were some really creative submissions. Really cool job Les, David, Miguel, Dan, José, Robin, Muhammad, Jean-François, Ten, Leyan, Prashant, Ryan, Laurynas, Andrew, Mo, Max, Dan, Thomas, Saad, Chris, Amine, Chase, Dan, Brian, and Cedric!

This week’s question:\
**Let’s say you have `n` doors that start out as closed. With the first pass across the doors, you toggle every door open. With the second pass, you toggle every second door. With the third, every third door, and so on. Write a function that takes in an integer `numberOfPasses`, and returns how many doors are open after the number of passes.** Thanks Max for inspiring this question!

Example:

```
let n = 7
let numberOfPasses = 3

> passDoors(n, numberOfPasses)
> 4

// Explanation:
// 0 means open, 1 means closed
// Initial: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
// Pass 1:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0
// Pass 2:  0 1 0 1 0 1 0
// Pass 3:  0 1 1 1 0 0 0
```
