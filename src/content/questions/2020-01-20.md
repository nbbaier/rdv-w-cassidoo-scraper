## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you implement the sum of n-digit palindromes. Nice work Dale, Andrew, Jehiel, Chuúke, Jeremy, Leslie, Louis, Ten, Cory, Oswaldo, Jaime, Ivana, Jacob, Dan, Austin, Julian, Dimitris, Lionel, Moises, Mayra, and Uzair!

This week’s question:\
**Given a number, return true if the input is a factorial of any natural number.**

Example:

```
> isFactorial(3)
> false
> isFactorial(6)
> true
```
