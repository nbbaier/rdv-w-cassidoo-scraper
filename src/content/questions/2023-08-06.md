## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write an anagram checker. It was awesome seeing all the folks doing this in a language they didn't know as well! Great work Laurynas, Miguel, Neil, Alvin, Clov, Ten, Saad, Pranav, Clifford, Muhammad, Arjun, Sreetam, Dan, Matt, Ollie, Chin, Jeet, Jack, Usman, Jonnie, Christian, Leyan, Pedro, Karthick, Kyle, Manuel, Craig, Chris, Eric, and Alison!

This week's question:\
**Implement the Luhn algorithm to validate a credit card number.** Bonus points if you can identify what brand of credit card the user inputted!

Example:

```
> luhnCheck(123456789)
> false

> luhnCheck(5555555555554444)
> true // Mastercard
```
