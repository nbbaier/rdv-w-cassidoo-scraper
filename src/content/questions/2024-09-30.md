## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you manage laundry loads. Y'all are so clean! Awesome job Nate, Leyan, Ashish, Tianon, Claude, Ten, Kostas, Alison, John, Daniela, Lucien, Jeremias, Ricardo, Amine, and Muhammad!

This week's question:

**Implement your own String** `split()` function in your preferred programming language.

Example usage:

```
const str = 'This is so, so silly!';

&gt; str.split(' ');
&gt; ["This", "is", "so,", "so", "silly!"]

&gt; str.split('');
&gt; ["T", "h", "i", "s", " ", "i", "s", " ", "s", "o", ",", " ", "s", "o", " ", "s", "i", "l", "l", "y", "!"]

&gt; str.split(',');
&gt; ["This is so", " so silly!"]
```
