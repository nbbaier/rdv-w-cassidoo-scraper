## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you rotate a string of brackets until it was balanced. Great work David, Leyan, Mark, Les, Jean-François, Rafael, Ben, Ivana, Szabolcs, Jay, Bassam, Thomas, Elliot, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given a positive or negative real number, round it to the next whole integer closer to zero.** This means if it’s positive, round down, and if it’s negative, round up. Try to do this in as few characters possible!

Test cases:

```
1.7    =>  1
-2.1    => -2
 500.4  =>  500
-369.5  => -369
 150    =>  150
-350    => -350
```
