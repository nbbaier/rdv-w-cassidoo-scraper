## Interview question of the week

This past week's question was a bit harder for you folks! I had to get sum combinations from dice with a random number of faces. Stuart and Matthew did a great job with their solutions!

This week's question is one of my favorites to give in technical interviews:\
**Given a string, and a pattern of alpha characters and the characters. and \*, write a function that determines if the string matches the pattern. It's like a baby regex matcher, where. can match any character, and \* represents 0 or more instances of the preceding character.**

For example:\
doesMatch(“abc”, “a\*g\*b.”)\
\> true\
doesMatch(“abc”, “\*bc”)\
\> false
