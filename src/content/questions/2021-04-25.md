 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given a string of brackets, return a rotation of those brackets that is balanced.** The numbers of opening and closing brackets will always be equal, so `[` or `][]` won’t be given as inputs.

Example:

```
$ rotateBrackets(']][][[')
$ '[[]][]' // First rotation yields '[]][]['. Second one yields '[[]][]'.
```
