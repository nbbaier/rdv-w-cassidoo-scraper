## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return the longest sub-sequence in an array. Great job Ali, Will, Les, Karey, Alex, William, Leyan, Ben, Vanessa, Will, Zoe, Claude, Rafael, Danny, Giovanni, Dan, Ivana, Ten, and Eric!

This week’s question:\
**Given a 2D array of 0s and 1s, return the size of the largest rectangle of 1s in the array.**

Example:

```
let islands = [
[0,0,0,1,0]
[1,1,0,0,1]
[1,1,0,0,0]
[0,0,1,0,0]
]

$ largestRect(islands)
$ '2x2'
```
