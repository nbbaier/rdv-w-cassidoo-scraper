## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you print possible sequences of letters. Great work Miguel, Raymond, Saad, Ten, Felix, Tawseef, Sagnik, Amine, Yosola, Neil, Arban, and Muhammad!

This week's question:\
**Given a 2D array, write a function that flips it vertically or horizontally.**

Example:

```
let array = [
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9]
]

> flip(array, 'horizontal')
> [[3,2,1],[6,5,4],[9,8,7]]

> flip(array, 'vertical')
> [[7,8,9],[4,5,6],[1,2,3]]
```
