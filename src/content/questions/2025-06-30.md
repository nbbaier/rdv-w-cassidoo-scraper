## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you deal with overlapping sirens. Wee woo wee woo James, Will, Burton, Winnie, David, Ten, Elke, Patrycja, Varenya, Neha, Michel, and Ender!

This week's question:\
**Find the last non-repeating character in a given string.** If all characters repeat, return an empty string.

Example:

```
> nonRepeat('candy canes do taste yummy')
> 'u'
```
