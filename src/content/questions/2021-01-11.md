## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return true if an IoT mesh network worked. Great job Dhanush, Leyan, Elliot, David, Leslie, Yao, Vanessa, Rafael, Gustavo, Artem, Ivana, Carlos, Ten, and Jonathan!

This week's question:\
**Given a n x m binary matrix filled with 0s and 1s, find the largest rectangle containing only 1s and return its area.**

Example:

```
$ matrix =
  [
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","0","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
  ]
$ largestRect(matrix)
$ 4
```
