 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Given two integers, generate a “fibonacci-like” sequence of n digits (where the next number in the pattern is the sum of the previous two numbers).** Extra credit: Given a sequence, determine if the sequence is “fibonacci-like”.

Example:

```
let n = 5

> fibLike(10, 20, n)
> [10, 20, 30, 50, 80]

> fibLike(3, 7, n)
> [3, 7, 10, 17, 27]
```
