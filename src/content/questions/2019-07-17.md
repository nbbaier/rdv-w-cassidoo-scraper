## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you write a simplified regex matcher! Sophie pushed out her very clean solution here, Dimitris  did his here, and Stuart gave a few different and modified answers in this thread!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes in a string and returns all palindromes that can be formed with that string if you rearrange the letters.**
