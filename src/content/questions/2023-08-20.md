## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you work with a "faulty" keyboard. Y'all had such creative answers!! Some were short and concise, and some had a full-blown UI built with them. Amazing job Waleed, Saad, Jonnie, Nate, Fraol, Chin, Ten, Usman, Dale, Sreetam, Laurynas, Praveen, Chris, Austin, Christian, Lucien, Karthick, Snowie, Muhammad, Mica, Neil, Tawseef, Alvin, Manuel, Craig, Chase, Alison, Clifford, and Andrew!

This week's question:\
**Make a "guessing game" where there is a target number, and as the user makes guesses, the output returns `higher` or `lower` until the user is correct.**

Example usage:

```
Guess the number!
> 10
higher
> 20
higher
> 30
lower
> 25
higher
> 27
Correct! You won in 5 guesses!
```
