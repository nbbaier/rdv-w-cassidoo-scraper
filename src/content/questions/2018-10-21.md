 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you remove excess parenthesis from a string. Laura sent this answer!

def remove\_excess\_parentheses(s):\
"""\
:type s: str\
:rtype: str\
"""\
\# maintain a stack of parentheses where each parenthesis also has its index attached (for removal afterwards, if necessary)\
stack = \[]\
res = \[]\
l = len(s)\
for i in range(l):\
if s\[i] == "(":\
stack.append((i,s\[i]))\
res.append(s\[i])\
elif s\[i] == ")":\
if len(stack)!= 0:\
top = stack.pop()\
res.append(")")\
else:\
res.append("")\
else:\
res.append(s\[i])\
for i,c in stack:\
res\[i] = ""\
return "".join(res)

This week's question:\
**Given a number n, return a list of numbers less than n which are a product of distinct prime numbers.**

Example:\
primeProducts(30)\
\> \[6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26]
