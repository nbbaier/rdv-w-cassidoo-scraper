## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you remove a digit in a number to maximize it. Awesome work Neil, Saad, Maciej, Altamish, Kyle, Mitchell, Goncy, Leo, Ashish, Hamilton, Jacob, Amine, Alex, Nathael, Chase, Angelo, Ten, Miguel, Ryan, Muhammad, and David!

This week's question:\
**Make a pomodoro timer where a user can start the timer, pause for a set break time, and continue after the break.** You can choose how you want to show your timer. A typical pomodoro is 25 minutes of work, and then a 5 minute break, and repeat!

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on LinkedIn, Twitter, Mastodon, or Bluesky)
