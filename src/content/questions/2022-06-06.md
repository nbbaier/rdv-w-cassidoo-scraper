## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you determine if characters in a string are unique. Great work Ciarán, Les, Will, Krupa, Ten, Tan, Kelvin, Nicole, OtterElevator, David, Leyan, Ben, Amine, Mike, Olumide, Dan, Justin, Gülşah, Owen, Ivana, Augustin, Hristiyan, Phil, Johannes, Wayne, Jorge, Don, and Divyansh!

This week’s question:\
**Given an int array `coins` and an int amount, return an array of coins that add up to amount (and an empty array if it’s an impossible combination).**

Example:

```
let coins = [2,3,5,7]
let amount = 17

$ coinCombo(coins, amount)
$ [3,7,7]

$ coinCombo([2,3,5], 11)
$ [3,3,5]
```
