## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return if an IP address is in a given range! Great work Gabor, Jesper, Dominic, Augustin, Tan, Leyan, Ten, Daniel, Andrew, Ben, Jay, Les, Craig, and Ivana, Rafael!

This week's question:\
**Given an unsorted array of integers and a number n, find the number of continuous subarrays having sum exactly equal n.** Return -1 if none exist.

Example:

```
$ subarraySum([10 , 2, -2, -20, 10], -10)
$ 3 // arr[0...3], arr[1...4], arr[3...4]
```
