## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out calendar availability! This was a tough one, but I’m glad some of y’all managed to get it over the line. Great job Leyan, Jesper, Mark, Jay, Steven, Andrew, Les (…you troll), and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Make a 2-player Connect Four game, where the `board` is 7 units wide, and 6 units high.** Your program should take in user input when a player puts in a piece, and have functions `boardState()` (which returns a 2D array of the current state of the board) and `hasWon()` which returns which player has won the game (if any).
