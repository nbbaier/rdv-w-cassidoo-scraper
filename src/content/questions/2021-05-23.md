 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Make a 2-player Connect Four game, where the `board` is 7 units wide, and 6 units high.** Your program should take in user input when a player puts in a piece, and have functions `boardState()` (which returns a 2D array of the current state of the board) and `hasWon()` which returns which player has won the game (if any).
