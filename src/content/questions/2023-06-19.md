## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you trim an array. There were a lot of very different responses to this one, which were super fun to read and run! Great work Austin, Vanessa, John, Manuel, Kyle, Leo, Jonnie, Heather, Lucie, Clifford, Saad, Hristiyan, Ángel, Muhammad, Amine, Ten, Usman, Kelly, Craig, Holger, David, Daniel, Carine, Miguel, Andrew, and Churchill!

This week's question:\
**Given some JSON data, calculate the maximum depth reached.** Both arrays and dictionaries increase the depth! If the input is invalid data, the response should be undefined (you decide how you want that to return).

Example:

```
> depthJSON([])
> 1

> depthJSON([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
> 1

> depthJSON([{"a": []}, ["abc"]])
> 3
```
