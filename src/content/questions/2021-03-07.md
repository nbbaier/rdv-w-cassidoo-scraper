## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out how much paint you’d need to paint a room! Nice work Pranav, Dhanush, Leyan, Leslie, Michael, Ivana, Elliot, Steve, Alex, David, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string array representing a tic-tac-toe board, return true if and only if it’s possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.** You can assume the first player will always play X first, and players will only fill in blank spaces. The game will end if there is 3 in a row, column, or diagonal, or if the board is full.

Example:

```
$ validTTTPosition(["XOX", " X ", "   "])
$ false
$ validTTTPosition(["XOX", "O O", "XOX"])
$ true
$ validTTTPosition(["OOO", "   ", "XXX"])
$ false
$ validTTTPosition(["  O", "   ", "   "])
$ false
```
