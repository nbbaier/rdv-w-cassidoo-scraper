## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement a data structure and some functions for the board game Monopoly. Hope you enjoyed that one!

**Implement the charAt() and contains() functions using the best runtime possible.**

Example:\
\> charAt(5)\
\> a

\> "fish".contains("i")\
\> true
