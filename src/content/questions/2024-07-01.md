## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a function around waiting for warmer temperatures. Awesome work Josh, Muhammad, Amine, Sid, Kriszti, Ricardo, Gu, Leyan, Ten, Patrick, Theresa, John, Mazen, Mahak, and Luis!

This week's question:\
**Define a `FruitStand` class that allows you to add different types of fruits with their quantities and prices, update them, and calculate the total value of all the fruits in the stand.** Implement the following methods: `addFruit(name, quantity, price)`, `updateQuantity(name, quantity)`, and `totalValue()`!

Example usage:

```
// Create a new fruit stand
let stand = FruitStand()

// Add fruits to the stand
stand.addFruit("apple", 10, 0.5)
stand.addFruit("banana", 5, 0.2)
stand.addFruit("cherry", 20, 0.1)

// Update the quantity of an existing fruit
stand.updateQuantity("banana", 10)

// Calculate the total value of all fruits in the stand
console.log(stand.totalValue())
```
