## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find a sum of four numbers in an array. Awesome job Muhammad, Sean, Amine, Ricardo, Nikhil, Ten, John, and Vyaas!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes a list of names and returns the names sorted by the number of vowels in each name in descending order.** If two names have the same number of vowels, sort them alphabetically.

Example:

```
> sortNames(["Goku", "Vegeta", "Piccolo", "Gohan"])
> ["Piccolo", "Vegeta", "Gohan", "Goku"]

> sortNames(["Edward", "Alphonse", "Roy", "Winry"])
> ["Alphonse", "Edward", "Roy", "Winry"]
```
