## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return points on a line! Awesome job Fraol, Ten, Jesper, Miguel, Muhammad, Vishnu, and Amine!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of integers, find whether it’s possible to construct an integer using all the digits of the numbers in the array such that it would be divisible by `n` (where `n` is `1 <= n <= 9`). If it's possible, return `true`, else return `false`.**

Example:

```
> divisibleIntegers(n = 3, arr= [40, 50, 90])
> true // 945000 is divisible by 3
```
