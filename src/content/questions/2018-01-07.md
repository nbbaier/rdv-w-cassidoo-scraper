## Interview question of the week

I got a TON of responses for last week's question!\
Instead of writing my own solution, here are links to a few great ones.:)

This week's question:\
**Given an array of integers, find whether it’s possible to construct an integer using all the digits of the numbers in the array such that it would be divisible by n (where n is 1 <= n <= 9). If it's possible, return true, else return false.**

Examples:

```
divisibleIntegers(n = 3, arr= [40, 50, 90])
> true // 945000 is divisible by 3
```
