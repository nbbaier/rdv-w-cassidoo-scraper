## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you check if an array is bitonic. Great work Saad, Altamish, Miguel, David, Neil, Muhammad, Jan-Magnus, Laila, Yass, Jacob, Ten, Sagnik, and Amine!

This week's question:\
**You have some gifts you want to return. Gifts bought in December have a 90-day return window, and all other gifts have a 30-day return window. Given a gift's buy date, write a function that prints the last day you can return the gift.** You can choose how dates should be formatted!

Example:

```
> returnGift('Dec 25, 2023')
> "Mar 23, 2024"
```
