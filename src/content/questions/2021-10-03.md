## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you evaluate a string expression with parenthesis! It was a toughie, incredible work Griffin, Jesper, Ten, Andy, Leo, and Rachel!

This week's question:\
**Given an integer array, find all distinct combinations of a given length x (with repetition allowed).**

Example:

```
$ distinctCombos([1,1,2], 2)
$ [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2]

$ distinctCombos([1,2,3,4], 2)
$ [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 3], [3, 4], [4, 4]
```
