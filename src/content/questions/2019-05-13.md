## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you calculate the angles in an n pointed star. Tom sent in an efficient Java solution!\
private static double starAngles(int n) {\
return (double)(n - 4) \* 180 / n;\
}

This week's question:\
**Given two arrays, return all pairs (where each number is in each array) whose sum is an odd number.**

Examples:\
oddSum(\[9, 14, 6, 2, 11], \[8, 4, 7, 20])\
\> \[9, 20], \[14, 7], \[11,8]

oddSum(\[2, 4, 6, 8], \[10, 12, 14])\
\> null (or whatever falsy value you prefer)
