## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find "islands" in the water. Awesome job Ten, Leyan, Ashish, Nathael (check out his visual!), Amine, Farzad, Ben, Saad, Kyle, Altamish, Ryan, Pozorvlak, Arban, El Mehdi

This week's question:\
**Given an array of numbers, add all of the values together but only if the number doesn't repeat a digit.**

Example:

```
> uniqueSum([1,2,3])
> 6

> uniqueSum([11,22,33])
> 0

> uniqueSum([101,2,3])
> 5
```
