## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a hexagon checker function! Great work Nico, Winnie, Muhammad, Marco, Sam, Lucien, Ross, David, Ten, Kriszti, Colin, and Amine!

This week's question:\
**Given an array `arr` representing the positions of monsters along a straight line, and an integer `d` representing the minimum safe distance required between any two monsters, write a function to determine if all monsters are at least `d` units apart. If not, return the smallest distance found between any two monsters. If all monsters are safely spaced, return -1.**

Examples:

```
let monsters = [3, 8, 10, 15];
let d = 6;
minMonsterDistance(monsters, d)
> 2

minMonsterDistance([5, 9, 14, 18], 4)
> -1
```
