## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return groups of repeating consecutive numbers. There were so many different kinds of answers, it was cool seeing all of your responses! Awesome job Will, Zoé, David, Nate, Fernando, Abdelrahmen, Miguel, Sreetam, 413, Alfonso, Saad, Ten, Leyan, Josh, Alvin, Claude, Dan, Fraol, Jesper, David, Chase, Sylvian, Phil, Kyle, Muhammad, Hristiyan, Ángel, Max, Sofi, Chris, Will, Alberto, and Neil!

This week’s question (thanks Tom!):\
**If you mix up the order of letters in a word, many people can slitl raed and urenadnstd tehm. Write a function that takes an input sentence, and mixes up the insides of words (anything longer than 3 letters).**

Example:

```
> scramble(["A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."])
> "A qciuk bwron fox jmepud oevr the lzay dog."
```
