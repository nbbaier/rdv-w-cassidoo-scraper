 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**Implement a hashmap from scratch without any existing libraries in your preferred language.**

A hashmap should:

* Be empty when initialized
* Have the function `put(int key, int value)` which inserts a (key, value) pair into the hashmap. If the key already exists, update the corresponding value.
* Have the function `get(int key)` which returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if there’s no mapping for the key.
* Have the function `remove(key)` which removes the key and its value if it exists in the map.
