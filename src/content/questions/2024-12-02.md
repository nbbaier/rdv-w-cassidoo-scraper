## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you organize a family meal! I fully messed up my own examples for the question and I apologize for that. Blame my sleepy brain writing code at that hour. Good catch to the folks who figured it out and worked around it! Good work smarties Ender, Yosola, Austin, Phillip, Amine, Andreas, Ten, and Eric!

This week's question:\
**Santa is conducting his daily roll call for the reindeer, but the printer has mistakenly printed all their names backwards. To take attendance properly, he urgently needs a tool to reverse the reindeer names and put them in alphabetical order! Can you help Santa?**

Example:

```
rollCall(["yzneT","ydissaC","enimA"])
["Amine","Cassidy","Tenzy"]

rollCall(["rennuD","nexiV","recnarP","temoC","neztilB","recnaD","diduC","rehsaD","hploduR"])
["Blitzen","Comet","Cupid","Dancer","Dasher","Donner","Prancer","Rudolph","Vixen"]

rollCall(["A","B","C"])
["A","B","C"]
```
