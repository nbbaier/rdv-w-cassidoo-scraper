 ## Interview question of the week

This week’s question:\
**You’re in charge of the fireworks display, and you have a list of fireworks to shoot off. You want to make sure you don’t fire the same colors twice in a row. Given an array of fireworks, return a valid firing order.** You decide how you want an impossible solution to work!

Example:

```
$ orderFireworks(['green','green','green','red','red','blue'])
$ ['green','red','green','red','green','blue']
```
