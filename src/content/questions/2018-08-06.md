## Interview question of the week

We had a bunch of great answers again this week! I asked you to merge some arrays and y'all were able to *sort* it out pretty quickly.\
Here's the responses (click each word to see them)!\
And Andrew gave a cool Python one liner!\
sorted(\[i for x in arr for i in x])

This week's question:\
**Implement a function that determines if someone has won a game of tic-tac-toe. The tic-tac-toe "board" can be in any format you prefer.**

Bonus question:\
Code up a tic-tac-toe game to test your algo out!
