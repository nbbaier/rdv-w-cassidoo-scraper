## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you figure out who owed what after a vacation. This was a sneakily tricky one, nice work Thierry, Aleksandr, Will, Les, Amine, Matteo, Giovanni, Leyan, Steven, Nicole, Philip, Ten, Divyansh, Conor, and Giancarlo!

This week’s question:\
**Given two integer arrays of size `n`, return a new array of size `n` such that `n` consists of only unique elements and the sum of all its elements is maximum.**

Example:

```
let arr1 = [7, 4, 10, 0, 1]
let arr2 = [9, 7, 2, 3, 6]

$ maximizedArray(arr1, arr2)
$ [9, 7, 6, 4, 10]
```
