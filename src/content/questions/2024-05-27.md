## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make an inverted punctuation checker. Great work Ten, Muhammad, Paul, Amine, Saad, Chase, Nikhil, Evan, Tawseef, Ryan, John, and Cristina!

This week's question:\
**Write a program that implements the `DelayedTaskExecutor` interface defined below.** Think about how it would work if you ran the `exec` function multiple times in a row, before the task is run!

Interfaces:

```
interface Task {
    // a blocking run
    void run();

    // when the task should be executed
    long timeStamp(); 
}

interface DelayedTaskExecutor {
   // executes task.run() at the given timestamp
   void exec(Task task);
}

// usage
executor.exec(new Task(10:00am));
executor.exec(new Task(10:10am));
executor.exec(new Task(10:05am));
```
