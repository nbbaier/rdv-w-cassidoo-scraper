## Interview question of the week

Last week, I threw y'all a little bit of a softball and asked you to determine if there was a rectangle given 4 integers representing the lengths of each side.

This is an quality problem. If all four sides are the same length, or there are equal pairs, you have a rectangle. One of you folks came up with another interesting idea, too.
