## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find an increasing subsequence. There were some clever answers, awesome work Miguel, Muhammad, Gu, Josh, Etienne, Amine, Kriszti, Charles, Claude, Ricardo, Saad, Ten, Mazen, Sreetam, John, and\

This week's question:

**Given a string `s` and a dictionary of words `dict`, determine if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.**

Example:

```
> wordBreak("leetcode", ["leet", "code"])
> true

> wordBreak("catsandog", ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"])
> false
// Although "cat", "cats", "and", and "dog" are in the dictionary, the string does not have a valid segmentation where all parts are in the dictionary.

> wordBreak("aaaaaaaa", ["aa", "aaa"])
> true
// "aaaaaaaa" can be segmented in multiple ways such as "aa aa aa aa" or "aaa aa aaa" where "aa" and "aaa" are in the dictionary.
```
