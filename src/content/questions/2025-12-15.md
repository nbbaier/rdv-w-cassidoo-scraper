## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a data structure for a deck of cards! You win Andrew, Miguel, Stephen, Krace, Parker, Paul, Micah, Jihchi, Toni, Zach, Amine, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Write a function to generate a Latin Square given a positive integer `n`.** The values can be any n distinct values, and don't have to be consistent for different n.

Examples:

```
latinSquare(1)
[[1]]

latinSquare(2)
[[1, 2], [2, 1]]

latinSquare(4)
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 4, 3], [3, 4, 1, 2], [4, 3, 2, 1]]
```
