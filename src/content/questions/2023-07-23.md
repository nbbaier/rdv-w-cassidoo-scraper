## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you separate groups of letters! Y'all killed it. Great work Tamás, Ollie, Ten, Leyan, Jonnie, Laurynas, Sreetam, Miguel, Kyle, Chin, Yosola, Daniel, Chase, Lawal, Manuel, Clifford, and John!

This week's question:\
**Given an array where each element is the price of a given stock on that index's day, choose a single day to buy a stock and a different day (in the future/later in the array) to sell the stock to maximize your profit.** Return the maximum profit that you can get from a given input. If you can't profit, return 0.

Example:

```
> maximumProfit([7,1,5,3,6,4])
> 5 // Buy on day 2, and sell on day 5, your profit = 6-1 = 5.
```
