## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you truncate a list of integers! Y’all did awesome with this one! Great job Daniel, Paweł, Saad, Miguel, Giovanni, Fraol, Nate, Eric, Elizabeth, Brian, Dan, Shannon, Muhammad, Ed, Sreetam, Leyan, Alberto, Ángel, Andrei, Max, Danny, Alessandra, Don, Waleed, Dan, Remo, Chris, Les, Ten, pohhj, and Kyle!

This week’s question:\
**Given a positive integer, generate an array in which every element is an array that goes from 1 to the index of that array.**

Example:

```
> generateArrays(4)
> [[1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]

> generateArrays(1)
> [[1]]
```
