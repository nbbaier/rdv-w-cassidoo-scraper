## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you convert between metric and imperial units. Awesome work Muhammad, Ashish, Alison, Ten, John, Kriszti, Amine, Nick, Ricardo, Tawseef, and Jasper!

This week's question:

**Create a function that should take one argument `n`, which is a positive integer. The function should return the sum of all squared positive integers between 1 and `n`, inclusive.**

Example:

```
> squares(5)
> 55
> squares(10)
> 385
> squares(25)
> 5525
> squares(100)
> 338350
```
