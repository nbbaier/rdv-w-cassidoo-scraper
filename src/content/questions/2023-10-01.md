## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find Pokémon strengths and weaknesses from an API. You caught 'em all, Neil, 413, Rincon, Francisco, Charles, Miguel, Ten, Dan, Martin, Don, Divine, Christian, Karthick, Sean, Frances, Augustin, Clifford, Usman, Josh!

This week's question:\
**Given two integers `source` and `target`, add operators in the `source` number to make it equal `target`, if possible.** You can return just one, or all possibilities for this!

Example:

```
> addOperators(123, 6)
> ["1*2*3", "1+2+3"]

> addOperators(3456237490, 9191)
> [] // none possible
```
