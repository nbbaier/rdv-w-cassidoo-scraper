## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you find anagrams in strings! Awesome work Ten, David, Muhammad, Brett, Ricardo, Kyle, Amine, Sreetam, Neha, Winnie, Shreya, Alison, Peter, Kriszti, and Gajendra!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) and returns the result.** The expression will contain single-digit integers and the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. You can assume the input is always a valid expression!

Examples:

```
evaluatePostfix('12+')
> 3

evaluatePostfix('56+7*')
> 77
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on Bluesky, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Mastodon)
