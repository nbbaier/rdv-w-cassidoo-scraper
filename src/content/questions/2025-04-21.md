## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you sum a connected path in a grid! Awesome job Muhammad, Ten, Kyle, Nick, Saleh, and Neha!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of objects representing ingredients (each with a name and amount per serving), and a target number of servings, write a function to calculate the required amount of each ingredient for the target servings.** Return the results as an array of objects with name and amount. Can you do this in less than 5 lines? In one?

Example:

```
const ingredients = [
  { name: "flour", amount: 200 }, // 200g per
  { name: "sugar", amount: 100 }, // 100g per
  { name: "eggs", amount: 2 }     // 2 eggs per
];
const targetServings = 3;

> calculateIngredients(ingredients, targetServings);
> [
   { name: "flour", amount: 600 },
   { name: "sugar", amount: 300 },
   { name: "eggs", amount: 6 }
]
```
