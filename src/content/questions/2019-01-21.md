 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return all the numbers less than n that had only the digits 1 or 5 in them. Check out  these three great answers!

This week's question:\
**Given two strings x and y, write a function that returns how many times x can be repeated to generate y. If y cannot be generated by repeating x, return -1.**

Example:\
repeat('pi', 'pipipipi')\
\> 4\
repeat('danger', 'cassidy')\
\> -1
