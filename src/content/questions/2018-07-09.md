## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you write a function that returns the longest number in a string. We got three great submissions here, here, and here!

This week's question:\
**Given a set (as a string), print all subsets of it. The subsets can be printed in any order.**

Example:\
printSubsets('abc')\
\> "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"

Bonus points: do it recursively!
