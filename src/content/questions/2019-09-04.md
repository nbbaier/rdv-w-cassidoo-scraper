 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

We had TONS of replies to last week's question about "special bags" that could hold a certain amount of weight. Nice work Sophie, Yuan, Ryan, Rachel, Dimitris, Sylvain, Ashir, Mackie, Stuart, Kyle, Joliebulle, André, Zandra, and Marcela!

This week's question:\
**Given two arrays, return true if the first array is sorted according to the second (ordering) array.**

Example:\
isSortedBy(\['cc', 'cb', 'bb', 'ac'], \['c', 'b', 'a'])\
\> true
