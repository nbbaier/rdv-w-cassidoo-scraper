## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you check on words that can be typed in one row on a keyboard. Awesome job Miguel, Fraol, Muhammad, Ten, Yuanchuan, Laurynas, Kyle, Mazen, Debabrata, Will, Danielle, Amine, Austin, Carine, Ángel, and Churchill!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of people objects (where each person has a name and a number of pie pieces they're hungry for) and a number for the number of pieces that the pie can be cut into, return the number of pies you need to buy.**

Example:

```
> arr = [{ name: Joe, num: 9 }, { name: Cami, num: 3 }, { name: Cassidy, num: 4 }]
> mmmPie(arr, 8)
> 2 // 16 pieces needed, pies can be cut into 8 pieces, so 2 pies should be bought
```
