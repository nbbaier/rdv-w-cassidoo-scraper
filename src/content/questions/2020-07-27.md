## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you convert a number into an irreducible fraction. Great job Jasper, Enis, Lauren, Matt, BK, Kaveh, James, and Ten!

This week’s question:\
**Given a string S containing only digits, write a function that returns a list containing all possible combinations of valid IPv4 IP addresses.**

Example:

```
$ getIp('11211')
1.1.2.11
1.1.21.1
1.12.1.1
11.2.1.1
```
