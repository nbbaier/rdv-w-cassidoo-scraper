## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you sort names by vowels. I had a typo in one of the examples, thanks y'all for catching it! Fixed it in the archive. Anyway, awesome job Josh, Ashish, Miguel, Mazen, Ben, Leyan, Sid, Muhammad, Amine, Andrea, Shreyans, Ricardo, Dan, Patrick, Ten, John, and Theresa!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes an array of daily temperatures and returns an array where each element is the number of days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.** If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

Example:

```
> dailyTemperatures([70, 70, 70, 75])
> [3, 2, 1, 0]

> dailyTemperatures([90, 80, 70, 60])
> [0, 0, 0, 0]

> dailyTemperatures([73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73])
> [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```
