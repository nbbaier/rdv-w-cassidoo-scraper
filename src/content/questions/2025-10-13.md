## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you create a changelog of grouped edits! LGTM Ten, Jihchi, David, Micah, Gavin, and Amine!

This week's question:\
**Given a CSV string where each row contains a name, age, and city (and values may be quoted, have embedded commas or escaped quotes), write a function that parses the CSV and outputs a formatted list of strings in the form: `"Name, age Age, from City"`. Handle quoted fields containing commas and escaped quotes.**

Example:

```
const csv = 'name,age,city\n"Ryu, Mi-yeong",30,"Seoul"\nZoey,24,"Burbank"'

csvToList(csv)
> \`
- Ryu, Mi-yeong, age 30, from Seoul
- Zoey, age 24, from Burbank
\`
```
