## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you implement a round of Yahtzee! It was fun learning how many folks had never played the game before. It's a good one! These folks are also good ones, with good answers: Muhammad, Max, Ricardo, and Ten!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.**

Example:

```
groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"])
[["eat","tea","ate"],["tan","nat"],["bat"]]

groupAnagrams(["vote", "please"])
[["vote"],["please"]]

groupAnagrams(["debitcard", "badcredit"])
[["debitcard", "badcredit"]]
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on LinkedIn, Bluesky, Twitter, or Mastodon)
