## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you return a subarray with the largest sum. It was a sneakily tough one to start the year with, awesome work Miguel, Valentin, Les, Bill, Jack, Leyan, Binh, Fraol, Chris, Muhammad, Saad, Henri, David, KurKestutis, Ten, Ricardo, Ángel, Chinar, Danny, Jun, Joe, Jan, Don, Louis, Dan, and Hristiyan!

This week’s question:\
**Given a number, sum every second digit in that number.**

Example:

```
> sumEveryOther(548915381)
> 26 // 4+9+5+8

> sumEveryOther(10)
> 0 

> sumEveryOther(1010.11)
> 1 // 0+0+1
```
