 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week, I asked if you were given an array of numbers, how you'd a list of all pairs that add up to zero.\
Here's my solution to the problem:

```
function zeroPairs(arr) {
  var pairs = [];

  for (var i=0; i<arr.length; i++)
    for (var j=i+1; j<arr.length; j++)
      if (arr[i]+arr[j] == 0) pairs.push([arr[i], arr[j]]);

    return pairs;
}
```

Here's this week's question!\
**Given a stack of integers, sort it from least to greatest using another stack.**
