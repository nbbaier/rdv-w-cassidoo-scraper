## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you nest an array! Why? Because I'm a rascal. Great job, fellow rascals Muhammad, Winnie, Miguel, David, Saravana, Elke, Tim, Ten, Austin, ashuzon, Tom, Brian, Neha, Kriszti, Patrycja, Max, and Tarang!

This week's question:\
**Given an array of strings representing a sequence of traffic light states ("red" for stop, "green" for go, "yellow" for slow), write a function that returns `true` if the sequence could represent a valid state machine for a standard traffic light.** The only valid transitions are: red to green, green to yellow, and yellow to red.

Example:

```
> isValidTrafficSequence(["red", "green", "yellow", "red", "green"])
> true

> isValidTrafficSequence(["red", "yellow", "green"]);
> false

> isValidTrafficSequence([])
> true
```
