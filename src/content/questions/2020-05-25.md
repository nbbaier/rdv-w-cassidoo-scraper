## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you build a mini version of Twitter. This was a toughie, but y’all did awesome! Great job Dimitris, Willy, Seth, Ten, and Jakob!

This week’s question:\
**Build a very simple text editor.** Your editor should contain an empty string S at first, and have the functions `append(t)` (add t to the end of S), `delete(n)` (delete the last n characters of S), `undo()` (revert S to the state it was before an append or delete), as well as any other functions you might want to include.
