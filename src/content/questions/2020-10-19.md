## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a basic Lisp parser! I thought this one was really fun, well done Roman, Rizwan, Wildu, Axel, Jay, Jaime, David, Mustafa, Leslie, Mike, William, Paul, Pozorvlak, Jonathan, Leyan, Rafael, Jeff, Jakob, and Ten!

This week’s question (another similar parser but a liiiittle trickier):\
**Given a string that is an HTML-like code snippet, return whether or not the tags are valid.**

Examples:

```
$ htmlValidator(\`'I love coding !'\`)
$ true
```
