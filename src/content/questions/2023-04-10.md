## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you print out the length of a program in English words. Some of y'all made this very simple, and some engineered something much more hardcore, and I loved all of the interpretations of it! Great job Miguel, Nate, Ángel, Jonnie, Saad, Ten, Leyan, Zoé, Will, Andrew, Carine, Alvin, Prashant, Austin, Muhammad, and Christian!

This week's question:\
**Write a function where given integer `n`, it returns the angles at each point of a star with n points.** Hint: The sum of the angles at each point of a 5 pointed star is 180 degrees, and at a 6 pointed is 360 degrees.
