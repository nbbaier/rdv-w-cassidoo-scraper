 ## Interview question of the week

This week's question:\
**Given a list of folders in a filesystem and the name of a folder to remove, return the new list of folders after removal.**

Examples:

```
$ removeFolder(["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f", "/c/f/g"], 'c')
$ ["/a","/a/b"]

$ removeFolder(["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f", "/c/f/g"], 'd')
$ ["/a","/a/b","/c","/c/f", "/c/f/g"]
```
