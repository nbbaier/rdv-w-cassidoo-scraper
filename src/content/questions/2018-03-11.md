 ## Interview question of the week

## Interview question of the week

Last week I had you make a visualization of the International Space Station location. Thomas Vaeth tweeted out his solution, source code, and source for his icons! Color me impressed!

This week's question:\
**Given two sets of rectangles (where each is represented by an array of four elements, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the upper left corner, and the second pair is of the bottom right), determine the area of the space in which they overlap.**

Example:\
\> overlapArea(\[0,0,4,4], \[2,2,4,4])\
\> 4
