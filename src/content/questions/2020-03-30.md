## Interview question of the week

Ten Sophie Dimitris Sameer Duncan Quentin Maty Stuart Giannis re:fi.64

\*\*You're given a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display. You can only perform two operations:

* Double the number on the display
* Subtract 1 from the number on the display
  Write a function that takes in the number X (the initial number on the display) and Y (the result that you want) and returns the minimum number of operations needed to display Y.\*\*

```
> brokenCalc(3, 10)
> 3                // 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10
```
