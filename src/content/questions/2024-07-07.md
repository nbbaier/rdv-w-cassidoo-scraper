## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you make a fruit stand! Awesome job Nicolas, Chase, Gu, Ricardo, Charles, Amine, Josh, Miguel, Ten, Ross, Muhammad, Theresa, Angelo, John, Krisztina, and Mazen!

This week's question:\
**Write a function that takes an array of integers representing the number of flowers planted in a line, and an integer `k` representing the number of additional flowers you want to plant. Return whether it's possible to plant all `k` flowers without planting any two flowers adjacent to each other.**

Example:

```
> canPlantFlowers([1, 0, 0, 0, 1], 1)
> true // you can plant 1 flower between the others

> canPlantFlowers([1, 0, 0, 0, 1], 2)
> false

> canPlantFlowers([0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 3)
> true

> canPlantFlowers([1, 0, 1, 0, 1], 1)
> false
```
