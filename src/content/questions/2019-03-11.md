## Interview question of the week

Last time around I had you map digits on a dial pad to a string. Kyle and Stuart had great responses! It was a challenging question, kudos guys.:)

This week's question:\
**Given a 2D array, print out the elements of the array in a clockwise spiral starting from the top left.**

Example:\
arr = \[\
\[1, 2, 3, 4],\
\[5, 6, 7, 8],\
\[9, 10, 11, 12]

\> printSpiral(arr)\
\> 1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7
