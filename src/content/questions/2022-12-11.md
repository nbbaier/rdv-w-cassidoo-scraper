## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you generate valid Settlers of Catan boards! This was a fun one, great job Ten, Leyan, Andy, Kareem, Saad!

This week's question:\
**Given a 2D array `n` of integers, and an array `m` of four (4) coordinates that represent corners of a rectangle in `n`, return the sum of all of the numbers in the rectangle.**

Example:

```
n = [6,  9, -7,  3,
     8, -1, -6, -4,
     2, -7,  7, -7,
    -1,  4,  7,  9]

m = [-1, 8, -7, 2]

> rectangleSum(n, m)
> 2
> rectangleSum(n, [6, 3, 2, -7])
> 3
```
