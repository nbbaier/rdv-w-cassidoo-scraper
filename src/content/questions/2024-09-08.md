## Interview question of the week

Last week, I had you pair shoes together! This one had some fun answers, awesome work Amine, Charles, John, Leyan, Nathael, Tawseef, Mazen, David, Sujeet, Alison, Kriszti, Ricardo, Kyle, Ten, and Daniel!

This week's question:

**You are given an array of people represented by integers, where each number corresponds to the number of people in a group. Determine the minimum number of rows required to seat everyone such that no group is split across different rows.** You can assume no group will be larger than a given row size!

Example:

```
let rowSize = 10

> minRows([4, 8, 3, 5, 6], rowSize)
> 3

> minRows([4, 5, 4, 3, 3], rowSize)
> 2

> minRows([7, 7, 8, 9, 6], rowSize)
> 5
```

(you can submit your answers by replying to this email with a link to your solution, or share on LinkedIn, Twitter, Mastodon, or Bluesky)
